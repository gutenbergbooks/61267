<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This work on the Surgery of the Skull and Brain is based on
experience derived, and on research carried out, during the past
ten years.</p>

<p>Cranio-Cerebral Surgery, though still in its infancy, has progressed
with leaps and bounds during the past few years. This
book represents the most modern aspects of the case and is
brought up to date by means of a recent visit to some of the
leading surgical clinics of the United States of America.</p>

<p>I have realized to the full the difficulties of the task which
I have undertaken, but have every confidence that they have
been overcome and that a reasonable measure of success has been
obtained. With this anticipation, this work on the Surgery of the
Skull and Brain is offered to the Profession.</p>

THE SKULL AND BRAIN</b></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="chapname">CRANIO-CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY</span></h2>

<p>The surgeon who is called upon to carry out operations on the
skull and brain must possess an accurate knowledge of the anatomy
of the parts involved. Added to this, he must have at his command
some simple method of depicting on the surface of the skull the more
important structures.</p>

<p>The more complicated systems of cranio-cerebral topography are
of little practical value to the surgeon. Simplicity is essential, and
the following outline will be found to furnish an adequate practical
guide.</p>

<p>Firstly, the skull can be divided into two lateral halves by the
surface-marking of the superior longitudinal venous sinus.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The superior longitudinal sinus.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">This sinus originates at
the crista galli and, passing backwards along the attached margin
of the falx cerebri, terminates at the internal occipital protuberance.
It may be represented by a line drawn from the base of the nose (the
nasion), over the vertex of the skull, to the external occipital protuberance
(the inion)&mdash;this line corresponding in its course to the
occasionally persistent metopic suture between the two halves of the
frontal bone, to the sagittal suture between the parietal bones, and
to the middle line of the upper or tabular portion of the occipital bone.</p>

<p>Secondly, each lateral half of the skull can be subdivided into
supra- and infratentorial regions by a line which marks the external
attachment of the tentorium cerebelli; in other words, by the line
of the lateral sinus.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The lateral sinus.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">This sinus is represented by a line presenting
a slight upward convexity, which is drawn from the external
occipital protuberance to the upper and posterior part of the mastoid
process of the temporal bone.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The infratentorial region.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The cerebellum lies wholly beneath
the tentorium cerebelli, and it is obvious that, in operations carried
out over this portion of the brain, the surgeon is limited in his field
of exposure, above by the line of the lateral sinus, and on either side
by the posterior border of the mastoid process. The division between
the halves of the cerebellum may be represented by a line drawn
vertically downwards from the external occipital protuberance to the
nuchal region. This line also represents the surface-marking of the
occipital sinus and falx cerebelli.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The supratentorial region.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Brief allusion must be made to
certain landmarks that aid in the representation of structures situated
in this <span class="nowrap">region:&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>a</i>) <i>The external angular frontal process.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">The suture between the
external angular frontal process and the corresponding process of the
malar bone lies immediately above the central point of the outer
border of the orbital cavity.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <i>The malar tubercle.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">A slight prominence on the posterior
border of the frontal process of the malar bone, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch below
the external angular frontal process.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>c</i>) <i>The temporal crest.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">A prominent ridge that is directed
upwards and backwards from the external angular frontal process.
The crest cuts across the lower portion of the parietal bone, passing
below the parietal prominence, and curves downwards towards the
upper and posterior portion of the mastoid process. It terminates
by becoming continuous with the upper root of the zygomatic process.
The crest consists of two parts, the upper and lower temporal crests.
To the upper is attached the temporal fascia, to the lower the temporal
muscle. The lower crest is almost invariably the more prominent.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>d</i>) <i>The parietal prominence.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">The central and most prominent
part of the parietal bone. It indicates the point at which ossification
commenced, and lies about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch above the termination of the
posterior horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>e</i>) <i>The zygoma.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">When traced in the backward direction, the
zygoma is found to divide immediately in front of the ear into three
roots, of which the anterior, merging into the eminentia articularis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
and the middle, aiding in the formation of the post-glenoid process,
are of no practical utility in surface-marking. The upper or posterior
root sweeps backwards above the external auditory meatus to become
continuous with the suprameatal and supramastoid crests, the former
of which forms the upper boundary of <i>Macewen&#8217;s suprameatal triangle</i>,
a triangular depression at the upper and posterior border of the
external auditory meatus. This triangle may be taken as representing
the opening of the mastoid antrum into the middle ear.</p>

<p>These landmarks having been determined, the following structures
may be mapped out on the surface of the skull.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The middle meningeal artery.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">This artery is given off from
the internal maxillary; after a short extra-cranial course it enters
the skull through the foramen spinosum, and soon divides into two
main terminal branches. The site of division corresponds to a point
situated just above the centre of the zygoma.</p>

<p>The <i>anterior branch</i> passes at first in a forward and upward
direction towards the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone,
and then turns upwards and backwards towards the vertex of the
skull. The main &#8216;danger zone&#8217; in the course of this vessel may be
mapped out by taking points which lie respectively 1, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, and 2 inches
behind the external angular frontal process and an equal distance
above the upper border of the zygoma. A line uniting these three
points represents that part of the anterior division of the middle
meningeal artery which is most liable to injury and which therefore
most frequently requires exposure.</p>

<p>The uppermost point may, however, be regarded as the &#8216;site of
election&#8217; for exposure of the artery, as, in trephining over either of
the two lower points, difficulty may be experienced in the removal
of the disk of bone, since the posterior border of the great wing of the
sphenoid tails off on to the anterior inferior angle of the parietal
bone in such a manner that to effect a clean removal of the disk
is often impossible. Another disadvantage to trephining low down
lies in the fact that in about 30 to 40 per cent. of cases the artery
occupies, in that situation, a canal in the bone.</p>

<p>The <i>posterior branch</i> passes almost horizontally backwards,
parallel to the zygoma and supramastoid crest, towards the posterior
inferior angle of the parietal bone. The vessel can readily be exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
by trephining over the point at which a line drawn backwards from
the upper border of the orbit, parallel to Reid&#8217;s
base-line,<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> cuts another
line directed vertically upwards from the posterior border of the
mastoid process.</p>

<p>Both branches of the middle meningeal artery possess important
relations to the cortex cerebri, the anterior branch passing upwards
in relation to the precentral or motor area, traversing, from below
upwards, the motor speech area (on the left side of the head), the
centres for the movements of the face, upper extremity, trunk, and
lower extremity. The posterior branch, on the other hand, passes
backwards in relation to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, one of the
so-called &#8216;silent areas&#8217; of the brain. Throughout their course the
middle meningeal vessels lie between the dura mater and the bone.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The lower limit of the cerebrum.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The lower limit of the
cerebrum can be mapped out in the following manner: From a point
situated about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch above the nasion a line is drawn outwards
which follows the curve of the upper border of the orbit as far as
the external angular frontal process, thence curving upwards and
backwards to the Sylvian point (see below). The temporo-sphenoidal
lobe sweeps forwards to the posterior border of the malar bone, and
its lower limit lies practically flush with the upper margin of the
zygoma. At and behind the ear the lower limit of the cerebrum
corresponds to the suprameatal and supramastoid crests, subsequently
following the curve of the lateral sinus from the mastoid
process to the external occipital protuberance.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The Sylvian point and fissure.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The Sylvian point represents
the site of divergence of the three limbs of the Sylvian fissure. It lies
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches behind the malar tubercle and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches above the upper
border of the zygoma. The main posterior horizontal limb passes
backwards and upwards to a second point situated <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch below the
parietal prominence.</p>

<p>The vertical limb is directed upwards for about 1 inch, whilst the
anterior horizontal limb passes forwards for about the same distance.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The fissure of Rolando.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">This, from a surgical point of view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
the most important fissure of the brain, is represented as follows:
A point is taken in the median antero-posterior line which lies <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch
behind the mid-point between nasion and inion, and from this point
a line is drawn, for 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 4 inches, towards the mid-point of the
zygoma. This line is inclined to the median antero-posterior line at
an angle of 67<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg; (three-quarters of a right angle).</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The parieto-occipital and first temporo-sphenoidal
fissures.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">In the representation of these two fissures, two points
require to be determined&mdash;the malar tubercle and the lambda.
Allusion has already been made to the former; the latter is usually
readily located as the point of intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid
sutures. A line uniting these two points corresponds in its middle
third to the temporo-sphenoidal fissure, and in its posterior inch or
so to the external parieto-occipital sulcus, a fissure separating the
occipital and parietal lobes of the brain.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The cortical motor and sensory areas.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The researches of
Sherrington and Gr&uuml;nbaum,<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Campbell,<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and others tend to show
that the <i>cortical motor areas</i> are situated entirely anterior to the
central fissure or fissure of Rolando, extending above well over on
to the mesial aspect of the brain, though not so far as the calloso-marginal
fissure, and in the downward direction to within a short
distance of the fissure of Sylvius. In the posterior direction the motor
area includes the anterior boundary and part of the bottom of the
fissure of Rolando, whilst in front it spreads, by means of gyri annectantes,
on to that part of the brain which lies anterior to the precentral
sulcus. The anterior termination is indefinite, but the motor
strip is, on an average, not more than <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in breadth.</p>

<p>The genua of the Rolandic fissure are said to bear a more or less
definite relation to the motor areas. In my experience, however,
they are too variable, and any importance which might obtain is
further diminished by the fact that the surgeon should never rest
content with that limited exposure of the brain which was so much
in vogue till recent years. The suspected region is widely exposed
by osteoplastic flap, and if doubt exists as to the particular part of
cortex exposed the question is accurately settled by faradization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span></p>

<p>This motor strip corresponds, from above downwards, to the
movements of the contralateral lower extremity (toe to hip), trunk,
upper extremity (shoulder to fingers), neck and face. It is a point
of some general utility to bear in mind that the temporal crest
intervenes approximately between the regions responsible for the
movements of the upper extremity (above the crest) and those for
the movements of the head and face (below the crest).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3. The Cortical Motor and Sensory Areas.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>On the left side of the head&mdash;in normal right-handed individuals&mdash;the
<i>motor speech area of Broca</i> corresponds to the third left frontal
convolution, in the angle between the anterior and posterior horizontal
limbs of the Sylvian fissure.</p>

<p>The &#8216;primary registration&#8217; of &#8216;<i>common sensation</i>&#8217; occurs in the
post-central gyrus, immediately posterior to the fissure of Rolando.
This tactile area occupies a position behind the fissure of Rolando<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
similar in extent to that occupied by the motor area in front. It
commences at the bottom of the fissure of Rolando and extends
backwards over rather more than half the exposed area of the post-central
convolution. It reaches down to near the Sylvian fissure
and extends over on to the mesial aspect of the brain. Furthermore,
it is probable that sensation in any given part lies on more or less
the same level as the corresponding motor area.</p>

<p>Immediately posterior to the tactile area and occupying the
posterior and upper part of the post-central convolution, the area
responsible for <i>muscle-sense</i> is situated.</p>

<p><b>Stereognosis</b>&mdash;memory pictures, object perception, &amp;c.&mdash;is
referred to the superior parietal lobe.</p>

<p><b>Primary visual impressions</b> are received in the occipital lobe,
more especially on the mesial aspect thereof.</p>

<p>Finally, the four areas concerned in <b>speech</b>&mdash;motor speech,
writing, reading, and hearing&mdash;are anatomically separated from one
another and yet closely associated, so much so that one can hardly
be involved without the other. The motor speech centre of Broca
has already been mentioned as occupying&mdash;in right-handed individuals&mdash;the
posterior part of the third left frontal convolution.
Writing lies immediately above and in front, in the posterior part of
the middle frontal gyrus, auditory impressions are received in the
posterior and upper part of the first temporo-sphenoidal lobe, whilst
the power of reading is dependent on the integrity of the supramarginal
and angular gyri (see also <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>).</p>

<p><b>Smell and Taste</b> lie in close relation to the anterior pole of the
temporo-sphenoidal lobes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="chapname">THE SPECIAL TECHNIQUE IN OPERATIONS ON THE SKULL AND BRAIN</span></h2>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Preparatory treatment.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Where possible at least two or three
days should elapse between the admission of the patient and the day
of operation. During this period the patient should be confined to
bed with all possible cheerful surroundings. The bowels are regulated
and the diet restricted.</p>

<p>The extent to which the scalp should be shaved and the time
at which this procedure should be carried out vary according to the
circumstances of the case. Much depends on the sex and age of the
patient and the nature of the proposed operation. Insomuch, however,
as it is always inadvisable to prolong the period of an&aelig;sthesia, it
follows that the shaving should be carried out previous to the operation.
With regard to extent, each case must be judged on its own
merits. For instance, considerable concession must be made in the
case of a young woman on whom the surgeon proposes to carry out
a subtemporal decompression operation, and in the case of a neurotic
or elderly patient who is the subject of trigeminal neuralgia. There
can, however, be no question that the limitation of operative field
advocated by some surgeons is fraught with considerable risk from
the point of view of wound infection.</p>

<p>If the question be discussed with the patient the surgeon will find
the ground cut away from beneath his feet, and that he has to make
considerable and inadvisable concessions. Taking everything into
consideration, although it is seldom necessary to shave the whole
head, I am accustomed to order such preparation as will allow of
a very wide margin. To shave the whole head is not only unnecessary
but is also exceedingly distasteful to the patient. The front, back,
or side of the head should be prepared only&mdash;on the morning of the
operation, so as to allow of a comfortable night&#8217;s rest. After shaving,
the scalp is thoroughly cleansed with soap and water, and the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
surrounded by a sterilized towel. The final skin sterilization is
carried out when the patient is under the an&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>The iodine method has always given satisfactory results, the skin
being painted, half an hour previous to operation, with a 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent.
solution of iodine, and again after the administration of the an&aelig;sthetic.
Still, I cannot avoid a certain penchant for the older method&mdash;sponging
with ether to remove the fats, washing with a 1 in 500 spirit
solution of biniodide of mercury, and finally douching with a weaker
mercury solution.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Precautions against the development of shock.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">It is
almost inevitable that all serious head-operations should be associated
with some degree of shock, though, from my experience, I am
convinced that, with due precautions, it is far less serious than is
generally supposed. The development of shock is very largely
dependent on the amount of blood lost during the operative procedures.
The various methods adopted to control h&aelig;morrhage are
enumerated later. In addition, attention should be paid to the
following <span class="nowrap">details:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Half an hour before the operation an injection of a quarter
of a grain of morphia should be given hypodermically. The
addition of one-hundredth of a grain of atropin, recommended by
some surgeons, interferes somewhat, by its action on the pupil, with
the data deemed necessary for the administration of the an&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>2. The theatre should be maintained at a temperature between
65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The table should be suitably warmed.</p>

<p>3. The patient&#8217;s body should be covered with warm blankets, and,
in the more serious cases, the lower extremities may be bandaged,
from below upwards.</p>

<p>It has been recommended that the brain, if exposed, should be
protected from the cooling effects of the atmosphere by irrigation
with saline solution at a temperature between 110 and 115 degrees
Fahrenheit. Personally I prefer to keep the operative field as dry
as possible.</p>

<p>An assistant should be told off, whose duty lies in keeping
a record both of blood-pressure and pulse-rate. The lowering of
blood-pressure is the surest guide to the surgeon of approaching
danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span></p>

<p>It is often considered that rapidity of operation is essential.
There can be no greater error. To ensure success the utmost care must
be taken to control the loss of blood, for which it is essential that each
step of the operation should be carried out deliberately and carefully.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The an&aelig;sthetic.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Needless to say, it is essential that the
surgeon should have at his disposal an an&aelig;sthetist of great experience
in head operations.</p>

<p>Ether is regarded with favour in the United States, and in other
countries, but we prefer chloroform on the ground that, by its
lowering effect on the blood-pressure, there is less venous oozing,
and added to this there is probably less tendency to post-operative
vomiting. I have recently had the opportunity of seeing the open
ether method as carried out in the States, on one occasion for an
operation lasting four hours, and in this and in other cases the patient
left the operation table in excellent condition, recovering also rapidly
from the effects of the an&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>The lowering of blood-pressure as produced by chloroform might
be advanced as an argument against the use of that drug, shock
being the greatest danger to be feared in these operations. Still,
I must say that I prefer chloroform so long as it is administered by
a skilled an&aelig;sthetist.</p>

<p>In any case, it is advisable to have oxygen ready to hand.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The position of the patient.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Special tables have been invented
and special positions advised. Thus, the dental-chair position is
recommended for operations on the Gasserian ganglion, and, in
cerebellar operations, it is urged that the patient should be turned
on his face, the forehead resting on a tripod, the shoulders on supports
fastened to the head of the table. Personally, I do not consider
that any special arrangements are required in the majority of cases.
Much can be done with sand-bags and firm pillows. Even in the
exposure of one cerebellar hemisphere I prefer to utilize the semi-prone
position.</p>

<p>In bilateral cerebellar exposure, however, the patient must be
placed on his face, the forehead resting on special supports, and the
shoulders on props or pillows so as to allow of free entry of air into
the chest. In such cases the an&aelig;sthetic is administered from below.</p>

<p>I am not enthusiastic over the so-called dental-chair position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
but the operating table should be constructed in such a manner that
the head and shoulders of the patient can be well raised, the body
being inclined to the floor at an angle of about 30-40 degrees.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Preparation of the operative field.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">When the patient is
fully under the an&aelig;sthetic, the final cleansing of the scalp is carried
out and the operative field cut off from all possible sources of infection.
In the States, in Cushing&#8217;s clinic, the an&aelig;sthetist is completely
covered with a large sterilized sheet, which is fastened to the head
of the patient. In this country we prefer that our an&aelig;sthetist should
have full knowledge of the progress of the operation, and I think
that the advantages are with us. In any case, the whole head is
enveloped in gauze, two or three layers thick and about 18 inches
square. This sheet is thrown over the patient&#8217;s head and maintained
in position by means of the scalp-tourniquet (see <a href="#Page14">pp. 14</a>, <a href="#Page15">15</a>). Around
this sterilized towels are arranged, either fastened to one another
or stitched to the scalp. When the operation is conducted in the
temporal region the towels, unless fastened to the skin by means
of a few sutures or safety-pins, tend to become displaced, and by so
doing add to the risk of wound infection.</p>

<h3>THE CONTROL OF H&AElig;MORRHAGE</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>H&aelig;morrhage from vessels of the scalp.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">All surgeons must
have appreciated the difficulty attendant on the application of forceps
to, and the ligature of, divided scalp-vessels. The patient may lose
a considerable quantity of blood, and much valuable time will be
wasted before the more essential part of the operation is commenced.
All this can, under ordinary circumstances, be avoided by the use
of the scalp-tourniquet. As used by Cushing it consists of a rubber
ring fashioned after the style of an Esmarch&#8217;s tourniquet, encircling
the head and passing from the lower frontal region in front, above
the ears, to the lower occipital region behind. A median tape, passing
from glabella to occiput, prevents any tendency for the tourniquet
to slip down over the eyes, at the same time acting as a convenient
landmark for the superior longitudinal sinus.</p>

<p>The tourniquet, when applied with the correct pressure, should,
under ordinary circumstances, completely control all h&aelig;morrhage
from the divided scalp-vessels. It should be noted, however, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
bleeding will be rather increased than otherwise if the tourniquet
be so loosely applied as to impede the venous return without compressing
the scalp arteries. A little experience will soon enable the
operator to gauge the requisite pressure.</p>

<p>There is one other exception to the satisfactory working of the
scalp-tourniquet. In the presence of a superficial cerebral tumour,
especially when of a malignant nature, the normal communication
between the intra- and extra-cranial vascular systems may be so
exaggerated that those scalp-vessels which receive diploic and
emissary venous communications will give rise to some trouble.
This difficulty should be overcome&mdash;not by rapidity in the formation<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
and turning down of the flap&mdash;but by clipping each vessel as
exposed or divided, by the application of pressure and by foraminal
occlusion (see also <a href="#Page17">p. 17</a>).</p>

<p>I found Cushing&#8217;s tourniquet rather inconvenient in its application,
and, after various modifications, am accustomed to use the one
depicted in the <a href="#Fig4">illustration</a>. It consists of two flat metal bands
connected posteriorly by a strong rubber connecting link, the two
bands passing in front through a metal fixation piece possessing
a screw which, when tightened up, allows of the maintenance of the
desired pressure. The median tape, previously <a href="#Page13">mentioned</a>, helps to
keep the tourniquet in position.</p>

<p>The tourniquet is applied as follows: the whole head is enveloped
in gauze&mdash;two or three layers thick, and cut to the size and shape
of a large handkerchief. The tourniquet is slipped over the head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
as low down as possible, and then tightened up. The median
tape, having a loop behind through which the tourniquet passes,
is laid in the middle line and tied round the screw on the fixation
piece.</p>

<p>The gauze should then be moistened with saline solution or some
mild antiseptic, so that it clings tightly to the underlying scalp and
becomes sufficiently translucent to allow of the recognition of any
underlying landmarks that may have been previously mapped out
with the scalpel, iodine, silver nitrate, or aniline pencil.</p>

<p>The scalp-flap is then framed by incisions carried down to the
bone, through gauze and scalp, in one sweep. The flap is turned down
and covered with gauze. By the adoption of this method h&aelig;morrhage
from scalp-vessels is efficiently controlled and the risk of wound
infection is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>After the completion of the operation, the scalp-flap is approximated
and sewn into position, first by numerous buried fine silk sutures
bringing together the aponeurotic layer of the scalp, and finally by
a few silk or salmon-gut sutures passed through the skin itself. Gauze
dressings are applied, the tourniquet loosened, and a roll-gauze
bandage quickly applied circumferentially around the head, low
down over the forehead and occipital region. This roll bandage in
reality takes the place of the tourniquet, but is, of course, applied
with moderate pressure only.</p>

<p>If the wool and bandage now applied over all should include the
ears, these two organs should be well covered with vaseline. Few
things are more uncomfortable to the patient than the contact of
wool and bandage to the ears.</p>

<p>The tourniquet should be utilized whenever possible. In operations,
however, that are conducted near the base of the skull&mdash;subtemporal
decompression, cerebellar exploration, &amp;c.&mdash;the surgeon,
in his effort at h&aelig;mostasis, must rely on the application of digital
pressure on either side of the incision, the more careful exposure of
the vessels, and the application of forceps as soon as they are seen or
divided, or by the utilization of Vorsch&uuml;tz&#8217;s h&aelig;mostatic safety-pins.</p>

<p>Other methods of controlling scalp-bleeding are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Kredel&#8217;s h&aelig;mostatic sutures, passed with a large curved needle
which slides along the bone and emerges about 5 to 7 cm. from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
point of introduction. The silk ligatures are then tied over metal
plates, so curved as to lie flush with the surface of the skull in the
particular region involved. Four of these plates would be used in
the formation of an osteoplastic flap, one on the distal side of each
of the three scalp incisions, and one along the base of the flap.</p>

<p>2. The enclosure of the proposed incision by a running suture
which, passing down to the bone, emerges about 1 inch further on,
then so to speak repeating itself in part until the whole region is
surrounded. The ligatures are then tightened up. This method
takes some time in its application, and presents no advantages over
the scalp-tourniquet.</p>

<p>3. The blocking of the main arterial supply&mdash;temporal, occipital,
and supra-orbital vessels&mdash;by modified safety-pins, mass ligatures,
&amp;c. Arterial compression by means of the modified safety-pin as
suggested by Vorsch&uuml;tz will be found most useful in those operations
in which the scalp-tourniquet cannot be utilized&mdash;subtemporal
decompression, &amp;c.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>H&aelig;morrhage from the bone.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Severe bleeding may take place
from the mastoid and other emissary veins, and from the open mouths
of those abnormally dilated diploic and emissary veins so often
encountered in the exposure of an underlying dural or superficial
cerebral tumour. The foramina in the bone, when exposed, must
be occluded as quickly as possible. For this purpose we have the
following methods at our disposal&mdash;plugging with small bone or wooden
pegs, blockage with minute plugs of cotton-wool, and the utilization
of Horsley&#8217;s wax, smeared over the part and well pressed home.</p>

<p>H&aelig;morrhage may also occur from the bone during trephining,
more especially when the operation is conducted over that part
of the anterior division of the middle meningeal artery which runs
through a channel in the spheno-parietal region. Here the disk of
bone should be removed as quickly as possible and the channel
plugged with pegs, cotton-wool, or wax.</p>

<p>Oozing from the raw surface of the cut bone is controlled by
rubbing in aseptic wax, or by the crushing together of the inner and
outer tables.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>H&aelig;morrhage from the dural vessels.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In this case the
bleeding may occur from three sources, meningeal veins&mdash;often of<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
considerable size when related to neighbouring tumour-formation&mdash;the
middle meningeal artery, and the venous sinuses of the brain.</p>

<p>H&aelig;morrhage from meningeal veins may be arrested by one or
other of the following <span class="nowrap">methods:&mdash;</span></p>

<p id="Ref01">1. Gentle pressure as applied either by dry gauze, or wet gauze
soaked in saline solution at a temperature between 110 and 115
degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>2. The application of a piece of muscle to the bleeding-point.
This method was, I believe, first introduced by Sir Victor Horsley.
Some muscle is usually available for the purpose, usually the temporal
muscle. A small portion of muscle is snipped off, spread out as
a flat muscular pad, the bleeding area dried, and the graft quickly
applied. It soon adheres, and usually arrests the h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>3. The application of a ligature. This method is placed last,
being the most difficult. It is usually necessary to underrun the
bleeding-point with a fine needle threaded with the finest of silk.
It presents the disadvantage in that the needle may perforate the
dura mater and puncture one of the superficial cerebral veins.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>H&aelig;morrhage from the middle meningeal artery may be controlled
by ligature or torsion, and added to these methods we have one other,
recently introduced by Cushing&mdash;silver wire &#8216;clips&#8217;. These clips<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
are U-shaped, loaded on a magazine, picked up as required in the
jaws of a specially indented forceps, and clipped on to the vessel&mdash;usually
one on either side of the bleeding-point.</p>

<p>H&aelig;morrhage from venous sinuses is dealt with on <a href="#Page150">p. 150</a>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>H&aelig;morrhage from the superficial vessels of the brain.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">This form of h&aelig;morrhage, one of the most troublesome complications
arising in head-operations, most commonly results from hasty or
careless opening of the dura mater. Thus, when the dura is incised
in a case of greatly increased intracranial pressure, the brain herniates
suddenly outwards, and the incautious use of the knife will damage
one of the dilated superficial cortical veins. The dura should always
be opened with the greatest care, the knife being passed lightly over
the membrane till the pia-arachnoid is exposed, when the dural
margins are lifted up with small tenaculum forceps and the membrane
slit up with blunt-pointed scissors or on a grooved director.</p>

<p>In the event of injury, the bleeding may often be controlled by
light pressure with dry gauze, or wet gauze wrung out in hot saline
solution as described <a href="#Ref01">above</a>. If this fails, a very fine silk ligature
may be passed beneath the vessel on either side of the site of bleeding.
This procedure is not easy to accomplish, the tissues are so soft and
friable. However, every effort must be made to arrest the bleeding,
for not only does the h&aelig;morrhage obscure the field of operation,
but the presence of a blood-clot beneath the dura mater will lead
at a later date to the formation of adhesions between the various
membranes of the brain&mdash;a potent cause of headache, epilepsy, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>THE OPENING OF THE SKULL</h3>

<p>Two methods are adopted in the exposure of meninges and brain&mdash;craniectomy
and craniotomy.</p>

<p><b>Craniectomy</b> implies the formation of a scalp-flap, exposure
of the bone, trephining of the skull, and enlargement of the gap to
the required size and shape.</p>

<p><b>Craniotomy</b> implies the formation of a flap of scalp and bone
in one, and the exposure of an area of dura and brain directly
proportionate to the size of the bone-flap.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Craniectomy.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">After the application of protective gauze and
tourniquet, the scalp-flap is framed according to the requirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
of the case. If the tourniquet is used, the knife is entered at one
extremity of the proposed flap, carried down to the bone&mdash;through
gauze and scalp in one&mdash;and the incision completed in a single sweep.
Under other circumstances, digital pressure is applied to the main
flap-supplying vessel, e.g. the temporal artery over the base of the
zygoma, or else Kredel&#8217;s clamps or Vorsch&uuml;tz&#8217;s h&aelig;mostatic safety-pins
are passed in such a manner as to control bleeding from the main
supplying vessel. In the event of bleeding, the surgeon goes along
quietly, deepening his incision and seizing each vessel as exposed.</p>

<p>In turning down the scalp-flap it is usually recommended that
the pericranium should be included. This is quite unnecessary, and,
under certain circumstances, should certainly be omitted (see <a href="#Page129">p. 129</a>).
It should be stripped away from the underlying bone as required.</p>

spiral perforator, spiral follower, and enlarging burr.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The trephining may be carried out with the hand-trephine, or by
means of saws, burrs, and trephines driven by electricity. With the
exception of a few words on Hudson&#8217;s trephine, I do not propose to discuss
the relative advantages and disadvantages of these mechanically-driven
instruments. I hold the opinion that the hand-driven instrument
is sufficiently rapid in its work, that it is infinitely safer,
and that the surgeon should accustom and perfect himself with those
instruments which are to him most convenient and most portable.
He will not always be conducting his operations in a perfectly equipped
hospital, much of his work will be carried out in the nursing home
or in the country. Whatever method be adopted, the operator
should use those instruments to which he is most accustomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<p>Hudson&#8217;s trephine is shaped after the style of the carpenter&#8217;s
brace and is fitted with three cutting heads&mdash;the perforator, the
follower, and the enlarging burr. It is claimed that injury to the
dura and brain is impossible, the instrument becoming automatically
locked so soon as the resistance of the internal table is overcome,
a thin film of bone being pushed in front of the advancing head.
I have had the opportunity of using
this instrument, and so far as my
experience goes it answers all requirements.
Still, I prefer the ordinary
hand-trephine so long as it satisfies
certain requirements. It must be of
simple mechanism and strong, the
handle of good size and shaped to
fit the hand, the shaft and head so
interlocked as to allow of no independent
movement, and the hollow
head sharply toothed and bevelled
externally, in continuity with the
teeth, for a distance of half an
inch. The bevelling is so arranged
that the actual cutting process is
only effected during supination of
the hand and forearm. The pin of
the trephine should not project beyond
the cutting edge for a greater distance than about &middot;2cm.
This pin should be readily removable.</p>

The intermediate size is used for ordinary trephining, the small one
for the formation of the osteoplastic flap, the large for the removal
of a disk of bone which includes within its circumference the area
involved in some depressed and punctured fractures (see <a href="#Page133">p. 133</a>).</p>

<p>The site of trephining may be fixed by the introduction of a
bradawl through the scalp, so indenting the external table that the

trephine is there applied, and the trephine directed at right angles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>

<p>The firm nature of the external table will be readily appreciated;
so soon as this resistance is overcome the trephine will be felt to
be cutting its way through a softer structure, whilst the increased
bone-dust and venous oozing will make it evident that the instrument
is biting its way through the diploic tissue. Greater resistance is
again encountered on meeting the internal table, warning the operator
that the time has come when greater care must be exercised. The
bone-dust must be wiped away, the teeth of the trephine cleansed
with nail-brush or sponge, and the depth of the groove estimated.
The groove should be of the same depth throughout its circumference,
or of that depth which is suited to the part involved.</p>

<p>The readiness of the disk for removal is best demonstrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
by digital pressure. When it gives to that pressure, whether in
whole or in part, the elevator may be applied and the fragment
removed.</p>

<p>In the temporal and cerebellar regions
special care is required by
reason of the absence of diploic
tissue.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay too
much stress on the necessity of
avoiding injury to underlying
dura and meningeal vessels.
Injury to these structures not
infrequently upsets the whole
plan of campaign.</p>

requirements&mdash;the formation of the osteoplastic flap by means of
the hand-trephine, Gigli&#8217;s saw, and de Vilbiss&#8217;s forceps.</p>

<p>The protective gauze dressing and scalp-tourniquet are applied
as before. A large <img src="images/illo025.png" alt="Upside-down topless triangle" width="23" height="18" class="inline" />-shaped
incision is made in such a manner as
to include the area which it is desired to expose. The two vertical
limbs of the incision should converge to such a degree as to allow of
the subsequent ready fracture of the flap along its base. The knife
is entered at one extremity, carried down to the bone, and the three
incisions rapidly made, one after the other. Along the line of each
of the three incisions, the pericranium is stripped away from the bone
so as to allow of adequate exposure. At the anterior and posterior
angles of the flap the tissues are retracted a little more, permitting
the application of a half-inch diameter trephine. Here the two
trephine-holes are bored&mdash;with the usual precautions against damage
to the dura mater&mdash;and the two disks of bone elevated and removed.</p>

<p>Between these two trephine-holes the dura mater is separated
from the bone and the special director introduced, entering at the
one hole, emerging at the other, and lying throughout between
the dura and the bone. The saw is now passed along the groove
of the director, the handles affixed, and the bone intervening between
the two trephine-holes divided, not straight out to the surface, but
bevelled or cut in such an oblique manner that the bone-flap, when
replaced, rests on a ledge (see <a href="#Fig17">Figs. 17</a>-<a href="#Fig19">19</a>).
The sawing process<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
generates considerable heat, and the assistant should be instructed
to keep up irrigation with saline solution or sterilized water. The
sawing is carried out by steady side-to-side traction, without jerks;
if the saw breaks, the special handle may be attached, thus obviating
the necessity of introducing a new saw.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The dura is now separated from the bone along the line of the
two vertical incisions, and the visceral blade of de Vilbiss&#8217;s forceps
insinuated beneath the bone, starting at one trephine-hole and working
downwards to the lower limit of the incision. It is essential that the
operator should be satisfied with the &#8216;morcellement&#8217; of small portions
of bone at each bite of the instrument. At the lower end of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
of the vertical incisions the forceps is directed inwards for <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch
so as to weaken the base of the flap.</p>

<p>To lift up the osteoplastic flap, a stout elevator or spatula is
introduced beneath the bone at its upper part, leverage applied, and,
as soon as sufficient elevation has been attained, the dura mater
carefully separated from the whole of the under aspect of the flap.
The flap is then grasped at its upper part with both hands and, with
a quick but forcible jerk, broken across at its base, the assistant at
the same time aiding the correct linear fracture of the bone by a flat
spatula applied to the outer aspect of the base of the flap. Insomuch
as the flap is most usually framed in the parieto-temporal region&mdash;for
the exposure of the motor area&mdash;the base of the flap, being formed
from the squamous portion of the temporal bone, is comparatively
weak. Fracture is then readily obtained. Under other circumstances
the base may be sufficiently weakened by the application of the
de Vilbiss forceps or by the use of the Gigli saw.</p>

<p>The bone-flap is thrown back and enveloped in gauze. Its basal
region is examined for a possible injury to meningeal vessels. In the
event of such complications the bleeding vessel is clipped, ligatured,
or underrun. Possibly some branch of the anterior division of the
middle meningeal artery, running in an osseous canal, may require
to be controlled by foraminal occlusion&mdash;with a wooden match,
bone peg, cotton-wool, or aseptic wax.</p>

<p>In comparing the <b>relative advantages and disadvantages</b>
of craniectomy and craniotomy, although there are certain definite
contra-indications to the latter method, yet craniotomy should always
be carried out when the surgeon desires to expose a large surface
area of brain, more especially in the exposure of a tumour diagnosed
to lie in relation to the motor cortex. Even if the operator should
be unsuccessful in his exploration, or, if finding the tumour, should
deem it irremovable, the dura can be sewn up and the bone-flap
replaced, resting on its bevelled edge, with little defect in the skull
and a normal surface contour.</p>

<p>The three main disadvantages to craniotomy are as follows:&mdash;(1)
the operation can seldom be done under much less than thirty
minutes; (2) there is some slight risk of complication through injury
to the middle meningeal artery; and (3) the dura mater may be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
adherent to the bone as to be torn in the process of flap-elevation.
Time, however, is usually of little importance; bleeding from the
middle meningeal artery may be controlled, and dural lesions may
be avoided by careful technique. In general, the advantages of
osteoplastic resection greatly outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>The more definite contra-indications to the formation of the
bone-flap are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. This operation is unnecessarily severe in most cases of
intracranial h&aelig;morrhage, e. g. from the middle meningeal artery.
It is also usually impracticable by reason of the associated damage
to the bones of the vault and base.</p>

<p>2. It is contra-indicated in operations conducted for the exposure
of the Gasserian ganglion, its root and its branches (trigeminal
neuralgia). In these operations it is essential that the operator should
get down as low as possible towards the base of the skull.</p>

<p>3. It is contra-indicated in operations conducted in the cerebellar
region. Even after cerebellar exposure by craniectomy, the surgeon
is working in a sufficiently confined space. The presence of a bone-flap
only adds further difficulty and complication. Added to this is
the fact that the thin wall of the cerebellar fossa is not adapted to
osteoplastic flap-formation.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Opening the dura mater.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Reference has already been made
to the great importance of opening the dura in such a manner as to
avoid injury to the underlying superficial cerebral vessels (see <a href="#Page19">p. 19</a>).
It may be incised in a crucial manner or by flap-formation. Flaps
are usually to be preferred if the surgeon desires to have the widest
possible view of the brain surface. In the formation of the flap,
advantage should be taken of the vessels that minister to its vitality.
Thus, in the lateral region of the head, the base lies below, the middle
meningeal artery supplying the flap. Under special circumstances,
the blood-supply may be disregarded; the flap never sloughs, so far
as my experience goes.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Sewing up the dura mater.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Considerable difficulty may be
experienced in sewing up the dura&mdash;by reason of the bulging of the
brain. How these difficulties may be overcome is dealt with on <a href="#Page236">p. 236</a>.
The edges should be united by numerous fine silk sutures.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Replacement of the osteoplastic flap and sewing up.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
flap is replaced, care being taken that its lower or fractured edge
does not injure the dura mater. The aponeurotic and subcutaneous
tissues of the scalp-flap are sewn up in the manner stated on <a href="#Page16">p. 16</a>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>After-treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Whether the operation be carried out by
craniectomy or craniotomy, the patient is put back to bed in the
so-called head-down position, the lower end of the bed being raised
at least a foot above the level of the head. In the event of shock,
a hypodermic injection of a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> gr. of morphia should be given, the
lower extremities may be bandaged firmly from below upwards, and
saline infusions administered, preferably per rectum.</p>

<h3>CEPHALOCELES</h3>

<p>The term &#8216;Cephalocele&#8217; has been applied to all those tumours
which project through a gap or deficiency in the bones of the vault
and base of the skull. The tumour may be congenital or traumatic
in origin: the membranes of the brain may alone protrude (meningocele),
or the tumour may be composed of normal or altered
brain-substance: all the varying conditions, however, are included
under one term&mdash;<b>cephalocele</b>. Congenital and traumatic cephaloceles
differ, however, so markedly from one another, both with regard
to their pathology and treatment, that they must be considered
separately.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Congenital cephaloceles.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Billroth and the late Professor von
Bergmann were the first to narrate cases in which this deformity
was present, Lyssenkow<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> added much to the previous records, and
de Qu&egrave;rvain,<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
by prolonged researches, drew further attention to the
subject.</p>

<p>Lyssenkow divided the congenital variety into two main groups&mdash;exencephaly
and cephalocele&mdash;the former resulting from a general
error in development (the &#8216;Acrania&#8217; of Muscatelle), the latter
a partial or local developmental failure. In <b>exencephaly</b> there is
an extensive gap in the vault of the skull, the remainder of the skull
being microcephalic in nature, the brain projecting outwards in
a varying degree, and the ventricular spaces distended with fluid.
In <b>cephaloceles</b> the hole in the skull is usually circumscribed,
although the sutures may be widely separated and the ventricles<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
distended with fluid, yet both skull and brain may be normally
developed in all other respects.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Exencephaly</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">presents but few points of surgical interest, insomuch
as the condition is barely compatible with life.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Cephaloceles</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">occupy a very different position. The condition
is by no means confined to man, and many instances are recorded
as occurring throughout the animal kingdom. Norsa Gurrieri,<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for
instance, records a case occurring in the embryo of Mus decumanus
vel albinus. The same writer insists that the developmental error
involves bones of either cartilaginous or membranous origin, and that
the atrophic condition of the bone is the primary cause and the
ectopia of the brain a secondary result.</p>

<p>Lyssenkow,<a id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> after careful investigation of tumours removed by
operation and after death, found scattered nerve-fibres, fat-cells,
striated muscle and vessels&mdash;the products, therefore, of both ectoderm
and mesoderm. He also observed the frequent occurrence of an
intimate union or fusion between the cephalocele and the overlying
integument, and, in consequence, the theory was formulated that
the greater number of cephaloceles were in reality cephalomata or
true teratoid tumours.</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, that a cephalocele results from the
incomplete cutting off of the neural canal in the head region of the
embryo from the overlying epiblast, with consequent fusion between
the primary neural tube (from which the brain is developed) with the
primordial mesoblastic membranous cranium (from which the membranes
are developed), and with the overlying epiblastic layer (from
which the epidermal portion of the scalp is developed). In consequence
of this localized fusion of layers, the outer dermic coat (from
which the membranous skull is developed) fails to form. Bony defects
therefore exist through which brain-matter protrudes, the projecting
portion often being intimately attached to the skin, and containing
not only epiblastic elements, but also mesoblastic tissue from irregular
occlusion of the same. The mesoblastic involvement is proved by
the presence in the tumour of muscle tissue, vessels, &amp;c.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Position of the tumour.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The tumour may project through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
vault or base of the skull. In the former case, it is almost invariably
situated in close relation to the middle line of the skull, from nasion
to below the inion.</p>

see text.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>1. <i>Occipital cephaloceles</i>&mdash;the commonest variety&mdash;occupy, anatomically,
two positions (1) between the two lower segments of the
occipital bone (inferior occipital cephaloceles), often involving the
foramen magnum and sometimes complicated by a condition of
cervical spina bifida, and (2) between the two upper segments of the
occipital bone (superior occipital cephaloceles), occasionally involving
the posterior fontanelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span></p>

<p>The tumour may possess a broad base or may be definitely
pedunculated. In the former instance the gap in the bone may be
of considerable size and the margins everted: in the latter case, the
hole may be quite small.</p>

<p>The deformity is frequently associated with other congenital
defects&mdash;hydrocephalus, microcephalus, spina bifida, hare lip, hernia,
and talipes.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sincipital cephaloceles</i> occur next in order of frequency. The
tumour projects between the nasal bones and the nasal process of
the superior maxilla (naso-frontal), between the nasal process of the
maxilla and the orbital plates of the ethmoid (naso-ethmoidal), or
between the nasal bones (nasal).</p>

(For further description, see text.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>3. More rarely, the tumour overlies the <i>anterior or posterior
fontanelle</i>. A case of this nature is depicted in <a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>, the tumour,
situated over the anterior fontanelle, bulging over the temporal and
frontal regions to a remarkable extent.</p>

<p>4. <i>Basal cephaloceles</i> protrude through the cartilaginous base
of the skull, either through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid,
between the pre- and basi-sphenoid, or between the basi-sphenoid
and basi-occiput, often projecting as a polypoid growth in the nose
or naso-pharynx.</p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>An interesting case of basal hernia was reported by von Mayer.<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The child, 3 days old, was admitted with a tumour projecting into
the right nostril, covered with mucous membrane, translucent,
encrusted with scabs, pedunculated, and closely resembling a nasal
polypus. The possibilities were fully recognized and all necessary
precautions taken. The right half of the nose was turned back as
a flap, the tumour isolated, ligatured, and removed. Death occurred
after six weeks. An oval hole was found in the left half of the cribriform
plate through which the dura mater projected and to the margins
of which the membrane was firmly adherent. The pedicle contained
ganglion-cells and nerve-fibres, whilst the parts removed showed,
from without inwards, mucous membrane, dura mater, arachnoid,
pia, and glial tissue.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Size, structure, and contents.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Sincipital cephaloceles are
usually quite small, but the occipital variety and those situated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
the region of the anterior fontanelle frequently attain a great size
(see <a href="#Fig20">Figs. 20</a>-<a href="#Fig22">22</a>).</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>It is not always possible to determine whether the tumour
consists of a mere outward protrusion of membranes (meningocele),
or whether brain-matter enters into the formation of the tumour
(meningo-encephalocele). Fluctuation, translucency, and pulsation
are all points to be investigated. All these features are, however,
deceptive, and several cases are on record in which operative measures
were carried out under the impression that the surgeon had to deal
with a pure meningocele, and in which it was afterwards found that
brain-matter formed the basis of the swelling.</p>

<p>When the tumour is large, the skin adherent, when no pedicle
is present, when fluctuation and pulsation are absent, and when the
tumour is of firm consistency, then it is practically certain that
brain-matter shares largely in the formation of the tumour. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
other hand, it is not unusual to find that the brain projects markedly
outwards without resulting in any symptoms of brain irritation:
fluctuation and pulsation are also not infallible signs, since the brain
may occupy the base of the tumour, &#8216;corking-up&#8217; the gap in the bone,
or the brain may be so thinned by ventricular distension that a mere
shell of cerebral matter lies beneath the scalp-covering.</p>

<p>Looking at the question from all points of view, it may be
accepted that most cephaloceles contain either true brain-matter or the
mixed epiblastic and mesoblastic elements described by Lyssenkow.</p>

<p>The following case serves to illustrate some of these
<span class="nowrap">facts:<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>The child was 3 months old, and presented a tumour, the size
of an orange, situated between the occipital protuberance and the
nape of the neck. The mass was pedunculated, the stalk being about
the size of a four-shilling piece in diameter. It was soft, translucent,
irreducible, and swelled up on coughing. An attempt at removal
was carried out, and, after incising the outermost layers, three ounces
of cerebro-spinal fluid escaped. A second tumour was then found
occupying the base of the swelling. This was also punctured, more
fluid escaping. Both sacs were cut away and the wound sewn up.
Death occurred on the third day, preceded by convulsions, retraction
of the head and neck, and high fever. The autopsy showed that the
fontanelles were widely open, the anterior measuring 4 inches from
side to side and 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> from before backwards. The bones of the vault
were markedly thinned. In the subdural space there was a quantity
of fluid, and the cerebral substance was soft and diffluent, the convolutions
flattened, and the ventricles distended. There was a broad
gap in the occipital bone, extending downwards into the foramen
magnum, and in this situation the cerebellum had bulged backwards
into the protruding mass. (See <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>For <i>differential diagnosis</i>, <i>see</i> <a href="#Page57">p. 57</a>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>Treatment.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">In considering the question of treatment, the late
Professor von Bergmann<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> divided the cases into two
<span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="fauxlist">

<p>1. <i>Inoperable cases.</i> When associated with premature synostosis
and microcephaly.</p>

<p>&#8199;&#8200;&nbsp;When associated with hydrocephalus or marked deformity.</p>

<p>&#8199;&#8200;&nbsp;When the tumour is situated below the occipital protuberance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Operable cases.</i> Limited protrusions with none of the above
defects and disadvantages.</p>

</div><!--fauxlist-->

<p>This classification undoubtedly forms a practical basis on which
to estimate the feasibility of operative measures, and it would appear
that sincipital and small occipital cephaloceles are the only cases
that come within the realms of operative treatment. In estimating
the possibility of operation, however, due consideration must be paid
to the fact that, in the very great majority of cases, the tumour
tends to increase in size, the bones become further thinned, the
margins of the gap more everted, and the development of the brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
suffers correspondingly. Again, in spite of the fact that some few
cases have survived to adult age, yet it is the general rule for the
patient to die within a few weeks or months of birth. For desperate
ills, corresponding measures must be undertaken, and in the consideration
of the more serious cases the surgeon should be biased in favour
of operation unless the general condition of the child shows clearly
that no success is possible. The best results have been attained in
cases of pure meningocele.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The unhealthy condition of the overlying integument,
especially at the apex of the tumour, prohibits any extensive
preparatory cleansing, this process being carried out for the most
part when the child is under the an&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>Scalp-flaps are framed from the region of the base of the tumour,
advantage being taken of the more healthy parts. These flaps must
be so sized and framed that accurate approximation and complete
covering to the gap will be attained at the termination of the operation.
The flaps are dissected back to their base. The pedicle of the
tumour is defined and an endeavour made to detach it completely
from the margins of the osseous defect. This is often a matter
requiring considerable patience. The sac of the tumour should then
be tapped with trocar and cannula, and the fluid contents allowed
to escape slowly, after which the opening into the sac is enlarged and
the membranes slit up towards the base of the protrusion.</p>

<p>When dealing with a pure meningocele, the membranous protrusion
is cut away in such a manner that sufficient tissue is left to
allow of closure of the dural gap. This closure can be carried out
either by means of a purse-string suture or by the union of two
lateral flaps. In either case, accurate approximation is essential
in order to prevent as far as possible the further escape of cerebro-spinal
fluid.</p>

<p>If the sac should contain an irregular mass of neuroblastic and
mesoblastic tissue, apparently not true cerebral or cerebellar substance,
this material can be dissected from the membranous sac,
ligatured at its base, and freely cut away.</p>

<p>If the sac should contain true brain substance, the possibility
of excision can be raised. In the cerebellar region such measures
are contra-indicated, and the surgeon must remain content with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
attempt at replacing the cerebellar substance within the cranial
cavity. This attempt at reposition will be aided by elevation of the
head and, occasionally, by lumbar puncture. If the protrusion
corresponds to a region which has no known important function,
it may be ligatured and cut away flush with the surface of the gap.
H&aelig;morrhage may be considerable, but can be controlled by ligature,
pressure, and irrigation with hot water at a temperature between
110 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit. The degree of shock attendant
on the operation may be severe, necessitating the most complete
attention to preliminary, operative, and post-operative details (see
<a href="#Page1">Chap. I</a>).</p>

<p>To <i>remedy the defect of the bone</i> Lyssenkow recommends an
osteoplastic operation, a flap composed of pericranium, together
with the external table of the skull, being framed from the bone
above the defect.</p>

<p>The flap is then turned down in such a way that the pericranial
surface faces towards the dura, and the fragment is suspended by
the continuity of the pericranium. He reports 72 cases so treated,
with 37 recoveries and 35 deaths.</p>

<p>K&ouml;nig and von Bergmann oppose this osteoplastic operation on
the ground that the extreme thinness of the bone seldom permits
of the necessary splitting off of the external table of the skull, and
that, even when such a course is feasible, the fragment undergoes
necrosis.</p>

<p>Transplantation of decalcified and calcined bone, silver and celluloid
plates, have all been tried, with no great amount of success.
Ssamoylenko proposes paraffin and vaseline injections, especially for
the sincipital variety of cephalocele.</p>

<p>When the surrounding bone is of such a nature that it is possible
to form an osteoplastic flap, that course should be adopted. Under
other circumstances, it would appear preferable to postpone any
attempt to close in or protect the gap in the bone in the hope that
nature will remedy the defect in part, the surgeon stepping in at
a later date with one of the measures advocated for the protection
of gaps in the skull (see <a href="#Page196">p. 196</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span></p>

<h3>TRAUMATIC CEPHALOCELES</h3>

<p>Many cases have been recorded in which a cephalocele developed
after an injury to the skull. In such conditions it is necessary that
a comminuted or fissured fracture of the vault should be present,
that the underlying dura mater should be torn, and that the adjacent
brain substance should be severely contused or lacerated. Cerebro-spinal
fluid may alone escape through the gap in the skull to the
subaponeurotic and subcutaneous regions, leading to the formation
of a <i>false traumatic meningocele</i>. When the brain shares in the outward
protrusion the condition is known as <i>false traumatic meningo-encephalocele</i>.
This protrusion of the brain is dependent on the fact
that the injury&mdash;necessarily a severe one&mdash;leads to considerable
brain lesion, with subsequent &#339;dema and localized or general increase
in the intracranial pressure.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the external accumulation of cerebro-spinal fluid
communicates with one of the horns of the lateral ventricle. A
meningo-encephalocele, having such connexions, is produced in the
following manner:&mdash;the protruded brain includes that part of the
cerebral substance which bounds one of the horns of the lateral
ventricle, usually the descending cornu. The ventricular channel
becomes elongated in the outward direction, towards and through
the gap in the skull, whilst the increased intraventricular tension
gradually dilates up the new channel, and, in course of time, still
further spreads out and thins that part of its cerebral boundary
which lies external to the skull deficiency.</p>

<p>There can be no question that after the patient has reached the
age of three years traumatic cephaloceles are of exceedingly rare
occurrence. This special liability in quite young children has been
ascribed to the greater elasticity of the infant skull, and to the
supposed greater adherence of the dura mater. Though these factors
may exercise some influence on the production of the tumour, it
seems more probable that the development of a cephalocele is
dependent to a greater degree on the general vitality of the child.
Thus, a blow that produces in the adult a comminuted or widely
fissured fracture of the skull, with laceration of the dura mater and
injury to the underlying brain, frequently leads to a fatal result,<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
whilst the child often recovers. Again, in the adult, the force required
to produce such a lesion usually suffices to lacerate the integument.
Consequently a compound comminuted fracture of the vault with hernia
cerebri is relatively more common in the adult than in the infant.</p>

<p>The right side of the head is more frequently affected than the
left, and, of all bones in the skull, the parietal is the one most constantly
involved.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptoms.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">During the first few days subsequent to the injury
the child merely suffers from the symptoms common to all severe
head-injuries&mdash;concussion and brain irritation. The osseous lesion
is obscured by the presence of a well-marked cephalh&aelig;matoma.
After the lapse of a short time&mdash;usually one to two weeks&mdash;the partial
resolution of the h&aelig;matoma allows one to observe, for the first time,
that a definite tumour remains. This tumour is irreducible, pulsates
freely, and may be translucent. If the protruding brain substance
includes the precentral region&mdash;the motor area&mdash;definite weakness or
paralysis of the opposite face and extremities may be observed.
Usually, however, no such symptoms are forthcoming, and the child
appears but little the worse for the accident. Shortly afterwards the
tumour becomes more defined in outline, and careful palpation will
reveal the defined margins of an osseous deficiency. Compression of the
protruded mass will often throw the child into general convulsions,
or induce a state of compression with dilated pupils, slow pulse, and
stertorous respiration. Compression, however, seldom results in any
marked diminution in the size of the tumour. The conditions may
remain stationary, but, as a general rule, the hernial protrusion slowly
increases in size and the child dies in general convulsions, preceded
by symptoms of brain irritation or compression.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Three courses are available in the treatment of
this <span class="nowrap">condition:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="fauxlist">

<p>1. Expectant treatment, combined with the application of
pressure.</p>

<p>2. Aspiration and puncture.</p>

<p>3. Free exposure and further treatment according to the
conditions found.</p>

</div><!--fauxlist-->

<p>In the majority of cases the local conditions preclude any
attempt at radical cure&mdash;the gap in the skull is large, the margins<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
of the deficiency are thinned and everted, and the brain enters
largely into the formation of the projecting mass. Furthermore, the
dura mater is torn and in a tag-like condition. Only in the most
favourable cases&mdash;when the tumour is small and the gap narrow&mdash;can
radical treatment be advocated.</p>

<p>The application of pressure&mdash;without previous aspiration&mdash;exercises
but little effect on the size of the tumour and, under such
treatment, the danger of brain-compression is always present.</p>

<p>Aspiration with the object of removing the fluid constituents
of the tumour, and thus of reducing its size, has occasionally been
followed by disastrous results. Still, many cases were so treated in
the pre-aseptic days, and the modern methods of cleanliness should
allow of better results. One or more aspirations may be carried out,
this treatment to be followed by the application of steady and uniform
pressure, preferably with the aid of elastic bandages, the degree of
compression depending on the size and constituents of the tumour.
The patient must be watched most carefully, in order to guard
against the development of symptoms pointing to cerebral compression.
Irritating injections should never be used.</p>

<p>One must acknowledge that this mode of treatment has&mdash;except
in a few isolated cases&mdash;not produced very satisfactory results.
Still, since an open operation is usually out of the question, no other
course remains.</p>

<p>The after-history of these cases is not very encouraging. In one
of Weinlecher&#8217;s cases the child was living 5 years later, but pulsation
was still present. In Lucas&#8217;s case the patient died 21 months
later from meningitis. In Sir T. Smith&#8217;s case, pulsation was present
3 years after the accident, and in Silcock&#8217;s there was no marked
change for the better after 11 years. On the other hand, a case
reported by Golding Bird steadily improved, and a second case
reported by the same writer gave every promise of a permanent cure.
The two following cases have come under my own <span class="nowrap">observation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>1. A female child, 11 months old, was knocked down by a van,
and, on admission, a large h&aelig;matoma was seen situated over the
right temporo-parietal region. The child was semi-comatose, but
recovered consciousness next day. The h&aelig;matoma softening, a gap
in the bone was felt, one-third of an inch wide, and extending from<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
the occipital bone upwards and inwards to the middle line. The
swelling increased in size when the child cried. Pulsation was present
and translucency was obtained. The tumour increased in size for
some days, but no untoward symptoms developed. For over one
month pressure was applied, but without much benefit, though the
general condition of the child was good. The edges of the gap became
thickened. The child was then removed from the hospital.</p>

<p>2. A male child fell 19 feet on to his head. He was concussed,
and, on admission, presented a h&aelig;matoma over the right fronto-parietal
region, and subconjunctival h&aelig;morrhage in the left orbit.
Four days later he was apathetic and there was some paresis of the
left arm and leg. As the h&aelig;matoma became softer, pulsation was
noticed over a small area, and, in this situation, the swelling increased
in size on straining. A fracture was detected later, one-third of an
inch in diameter, and extending across the left frontal bone to the
right temporal region. Pressure was applied, the tumour steadily
decreased in size, and eventually the gap was completely closed.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures of the skull resulting from injuries received
at or shortly after birth.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In the consideration of injuries to the
skull and brain in babies the following points should be <span class="nowrap">noted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The bones of the skull are elastic and pliable, and consequently
a blow may lead to a &#8216;bending-in&#8217;, either temporary or permanent.
Slight depressions may exist without any associated fracture, but all
major depressions are accompanied by a fracture of the bone,
especially evident on examination of the internal table.</p>

<p>2. The fibrous tissue intervening between the component parts
of the vault tends to cause a limitation of the fracture to the particular
bone affected. Downward extension to the base is of infrequent
occurrence, but, when that region is involved, the fracture usually
follows the transbasic lines described in the section dealing with
fracture of the base of the skull (<a href="#Page82">p. 82</a>).</p>

<p>3. The dura is said to be more adherent to the inner table of the
skull than in adults. The relative infrequency in the young of extra-dural
h&aelig;morrhage has been ascribed to this peculiarity. It would
appear, however, more probable that the rarity of such h&aelig;morrhages
results from the bending-in, <i>without splintering</i>, of the bone.</p>

<p>4. The brain of the infant is equally&mdash;if not more&mdash;liable to
bruising and laceration, but the results are far less definite than in
adults. There can be no question that extensive cerebral injury may
exist in the child without leading to the development of any definite
localizing symptoms.</p>

<h3>FRACTURES OF THE VAULT</h3>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>a</i>) <b>Depressed fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Depressed fractures either result
from injury received during the birth of the child&mdash;whether from
forceps delivery or from the pressure exerted on the head by a contracted
pelvis&mdash;or from blows received shortly after birth.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig23">

<img src="images/illo045.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="391" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23. A Depressed Birth-fracture.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The depression, varying greatly in depth and extent, may be
situated over any part of the skull, but commonly involves the
fronto-parietal region. It is often obscured in the early stages by
the presence of an overlying h&aelig;matoma, the condition perhaps only
being discovered after the absorption of the blood-clot. In many
cases no symptoms result, partly owing to the shallowness of the
depression and partly due to the situation of the lesion over one<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
of the so-called &#8216;silent&#8217; areas of the brain. Under other circumstances
the child may evidence the general increase in the intracranial
pressure by cyanosis, difficulty in respiration, unconsciousness, and
slow pulse. The anterior fontanelle will be tense, and pulsation will
be absent or greatly diminished&mdash;a feature of the greatest diagnostic
value. Localizing symptoms ensue when an extensive depression is
situated over the motor area, the extremities of the opposite side
being flaccid, or evidencing irritation by twitchings and convulsions.
The ready response of the infant to cortical irritation frequently
results in the early transformation of local twitchings into general
convulsions.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Course and treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">It is often stated that these depressed
fractures remedy themselves in the course of time, the development of
the underlying cortex curing the depression by the outward leverage
exerted. In the minor degrees of depression there may be some chance
of such spontaneous cure. I am, however, entirely opposed to the
view that spontaneous cure is the rule, and there can be no question
that the more severe types of depression remain as permanent defects
unless surgical remedies are adopted. Furthermore, even if the
deformity should cure itself in time, the intermediate dangers are<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
not to be disregarded, for, during the process of spontaneous cure,
there is a decided liability for the depressed cortex to lag behind in
the process of development, or to undergo degenerative changes as
the result of the pressure exerted&mdash;with disastrous results on the
parts supplied by the region compressed. Mental deficiency, paralyses,
and contractures will result, and there is every reason to believe that
some cases of infantile paralysis are dependent on this lesion.</p>

<p>The following case, recently under my care, adds further proof to
the statement that spontaneous cure is usually out of the <span class="nowrap">question:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>The child, 10 weeks old, was admitted with a depressed fracture
over the parieto-frontal region, oval in shape, and about 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches
in its long antero-posterior diameter. The centre of the depression
lay about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches below a normal surface. The injury was produced
at birth (contracted pelvis), and frequent convulsions were
observed during the first few days of life. The fits then ceased, but
the depression became, if anything, more marked day by day. The
child was then brought up to see me. The depression was exposed
by a suitable scalp-flap and a small trephine hole made immediately
posterior to the depression. The dura mater was stripped away
from the under surface of the bone and every effort made to remedy
the depression. No impression was thus made on the defect. The
whole depressed area was then cut out with a pair of scissors, the
segment removed, wrapped up in a piece of gauze, and forcibly
manipulated in the hope that the depression could be overcome and
the segment placed back in the normal position. This attempt was
also greeted with failure. The segment was then placed back in the
inverted position, the dural surface external and vice versa. The
segment required some trimming with the scissors before it fitted
accurately in position. The scalp-flap was then replaced. The child
suffered but very slightly from the operation, firm union was present
in two weeks, and, six months later, examination of the skull showed
that the two sides were absolutely symmetrical.</p>

<p>It should be noted that, although the child was only 10 weeks
old, and in spite of the fact that the depression was fully exposed,
it was quite impossible to lever up the depressed bone. This hardly
coincides with the views of those who maintain that birth-depressions
undergo spontaneous cure.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>Taking all these facts into consideration, it would appear advisable
to adopt the following course:&mdash;slight depressions, situated in
the region of &#8216;silent&#8217; areas of the brain, may be left for one or two
weeks, and, in the event of failure at spontaneous cure, the depression
must be elevated. In all the more serious cases, whether associated
with symptoms of brain-pressure or not, surgical interference is
imperative.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The baby would be well wrapped up and, after
shaving and cleansing of the scalp, the scalp-tourniquet applied.
Babies stand these operations exceedingly well so long as h&aelig;morrhage
is but slight. A scalp-flap is turned down and a small trephine
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch diameter) applied immediately to one side of the depression,
the trephine circle including the outer margin of the depressed area.
The dura is stripped away and a flat periosteal elevator introduced
so that its apex corresponds to the apex of the depression. An attempt
is then made to lever the depressed area in the outward direction.
If that result be attained, well and good. The flap is replaced and
dressings applied. In many cases, however, the elevated region
promptly assumes its original depressed position as soon as the elevator
is removed, and, in other cases, all attempts at rectification of the
deformity are of no avail. Under these circumstances, it is advisable
to carry out the method advocated by Nicholl&mdash;adopted in the case
described above&mdash;the whole of the depressed area being cut out with
blunt-pointed scissors, reduced to a more normal curvature by
manipulation between layers of gauze, and replaced in the inverted
position, the original dural surface becoming now external. This
inversion is requisite, as it is usually quite impossible&mdash;even under
considerable pressure&mdash;to reduce the depression to a permanently
satisfactory degree.</p>

<p>Nicholl reports on 23 cases, the ages of the patients varying
from 3 weeks to 8 years. The first 13 cases were treated by elevation.
The results obtained were most unsatisfactory, complete reduction of
the deformity seldom being attained, whilst recurrence, of a greater
or lesser degree, was the rule.</p>

<p>In the last 10 cases the inversion method was carried out,
with, in all cases, satisfactory results. Bony union was present in
10 days.</p>

<p>Four cases of depressed birth-fractures have come under my own
care. In two cases the depression was elevated&mdash;in both cases with
considerable difficulty&mdash;whilst in the other two cases, after failure<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
of leverage, Nicholl&#8217;s method was carried out, in both cases with
eminently satisfactory results.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <b>Fissured fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fissured fractures are especially prone
to involve the parietal bone, and, in their direction, to follow the lines
of ossification. Thus, in the case of the parietal bone, the fissures will
radiate from the parietal prominence. There is also a certain tendency
for the fracture to remain limited to the particular bone affected.</p>

<p>The presence and extent of the fracture is commonly obscured
by the overlying h&aelig;matoma, which is either subpericranial or subaponeurotic.
On the other hand, the h&aelig;matoma may, from its size
and shape, supply evidence as to the nature of the underlying lesion.
Thus, when confined to the parietal bone, it may be inferred that the
fracture is also limited to that region. Again, when linear, the presumption
is that the fracture is of a similar nature. A definite
diagnosis may be impossible without aspiration or till after absorption
of the h&aelig;matoma. The fissure will then be found to vary in extent
from a mere crack in the bone to a wide gap as broad or broader than
the width of the finger. In a case recently under my care the fissure,
over half an inch in breadth, extended from the vertex to the base,
whilst throughout the whole extent of the gap pulsation was readily
obtained.</p>

<p>Fissured fractures in the very young possess another point of
interest in that the cleft often tends to increase, this being notably
the case when the fracture is associated with injury to underlying
dura and brain. The local and general increase of intracranial
pressure not only widens the gap, but also leads to thinning and
eversion of the margins of the deficiency with possible herniation of
brain-matter&mdash;traumatic cephalocele.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Symptoms.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">In many cases&mdash;in spite of the severity of the
lesion&mdash;there are no symptoms, the child appearing but little the
worse for the accident. In most cases, however, the child evidences
symptoms of brain-concussion, irritation, or compression, for which
conditions reference should be made to the sections dealing with those
subjects.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the anterior fontanelle supplies
evidence as to increase or decrease of intracranial pressure. In
concussion the fontanelle is depressed, in compression it is tense and<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
pulsation is absent or diminished. Irritation of the brain is evidenced
by irritability and general convulsions.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">In the absence of symptoms, or when the fracture
is associated with concussion or irritation, operative measures are
contra-indicated, the patient being treated after the general principles
laid down for those conditions.</p>

<p>When associated with symptoms of brain-compression, exploration
is almost always advisable, the scalp-tourniquet being applied
and the injured region exposed by a suitable scalp-flap. Depressed
bone is elevated, or the trephine applied so as to fully expose the
underlying dura mater. A bulging, non-pulsatile, and plum-coloured
membrane points to the existence of a subdural h&aelig;matoma. The
membrane is then incised and the clot evacuated. Whenever possible
the dura mater should be sewn up and the scalp-flap replaced without
drainage.</p>

<p>Operative measures are also indicated when a linear fracture
gapes widely&mdash;especially when the gap shows a tendency to increase
in width. The steps of such an operation are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Expose the fracture throughout its whole length.</p>

<p>2. Cut away all pericranium or fibrous tissue that intervenes
between the margins of the cleft.</p>

<p>3. Separate the dura mater from the bone on either side of the
cleft for a distance of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, at the same time sewing up any
rents in the membrane.</p>

<p>4. Bore a few holes through the skull&mdash;using an ordinary
bradawl&mdash;on either side of the cleft, the holes being placed about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch apart.</p>

<p>5. Approximate and lace the margins of the cleft by means of
fine silver wire or strong catgut.</p>

<p>6. Sew up the flap without drainage.</p>

<h3>BIRTH-H&AElig;MORRHAGES</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Extracranial h&aelig;morrhages.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">As the result of injury sustained
during protracted labour, h&aelig;matomata may develop beneath the
aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis or underneath the pericranium,
the latter being the more common situation. The right side of the
head is the more frequently involved, and the parietal region is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
part usually affected. Occasionally these h&aelig;matomata are bilateral
and symmetrical.</p>

<p>The two varieties of cephalh&aelig;matoma&mdash;subaponeurotic and subpericranial&mdash;possess
certain peculiarities that aid materially in their
differential diagnosis.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Subaponeurotic h&aelig;matomata.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The blood, though spreading
widely throughout the subaponeurotic space, tends to gravitate
towards the lower confines of that space, and, from the position
assumed by the patient, is most evident in the occipital region.
The presence of the blood is evidenced by &#339;dema, doughiness, and
ecchymosis.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Subpericranial h&aelig;matomata.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The blood is confined to the region
of the particular bone affected, usually the right parietal bone.
This is due to the fact that the pericranium blends at the margins
of the bone with the tissue intervening between that bone and the
neighbouring parts of the skull.</p>

<p>Subpericranial h&aelig;matomata present further peculiarities. The
tumour is usually more or less circular in outline, and fluctuates
freely. It may arise immediately after the birth of the child, but,
more commonly, some two or three days elapse before attention is
drawn to its existence. Within a few days clotting occurs at the
periphery of the h&aelig;matoma with the formation of a circumferential
ridge. The central portion of the clot remains soft but tense, so much
so that firm pressure is required before the examining finger is enabled
to feel the underlying bone. These cephalh&aelig;matomata are not
infrequently mistaken for depressed fractures, but no difficulty should
be experienced if the existence of the circumferential ridge be appreciated
and if the underlying bone can be felt at the centre of the
tumour. In cases of doubt the blood should be drawn off by aspiration
and the swelling again examined.</p>

<p>For <i>differential diagnosis</i>, see <a href="#Page57">p. 57</a>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The less extensive h&aelig;matomata require no active
surgical treatment, the absorption of the clot being aided by protection
of the part and by cooling lotions.</p>

<p>Similar expectant treatment is generally advised with regard to
the extensive subpericranial h&aelig;matomata, but as infection of the
clot may take place, and as its resolution invariably requires a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
period of time&mdash;often many weeks&mdash;more active measures
can be adopted. The region of the h&aelig;matoma is carefully shaved
and cleansed, and, under local an&aelig;sthesia, a small incision made
through the scalp, the clot squeezed out, and firm pressure applied.
Under this form of treatment the patient is well within a few days.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Intracranial birth-h&aelig;morrhages.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Attention was first drawn
to the question of intracranial birth-h&aelig;morrhages by Little, who
showed that a history of difficult labour could be obtained in a large
percentage of cases in which children in after-life suffered from uni-
or bilateral spastic paraplegia; hence the name, &#8216;Little&#8217;s disease&#8217;
or birth palsy. Further information was supplied by Sarah MacNutt,
and the whole question was fully investigated by Harvey Cushing.</p>

<p>In all cases a history of difficult and protracted labour can be
obtained, with considerable post-partum respiratory difficulties, the
child being described as &#8216;blue in the face&#8217; for some hours after birth.</p>

<p>The stress and strain which the advancing head undergoes, and
the consequent moulding and overlapping of the various segments
of the skull, exposes the brain to great alterations of pressure, and
throws considerable tension on the intracranial veins. It is, in fact,
rather surprising that birth-h&aelig;morrhages are not more common.</p>

<p>The h&aelig;morrhages may be wholly within the meshes of the pia-arachnoid
system, but, in the great majority of cases, the lesion is more
serious, and the extravasation comes to lie within the subdural space.</p>

<p>Occasionally the bleeding takes place beneath the tentorium
cerebelli, the blood-clot lying in relation to the pons and medulla.
Such h&aelig;morrhages are said to be observed only in vertex presentations.
The more common supratentorial h&aelig;morrhages&mdash;usually
resulting from difficult breech presentations&mdash;either remain more or
less localized to a certain region of the cortex, or become widely
diffused over the surface and base of the brain.</p>

<p>It is probable that Cushing is correct in his observations with
respect to the source of these supratentorial h&aelig;morrhages. He states
that the blood is derived from one or more radicles of the superior
longitudinal sinus, especially from those veins which, in their upward
passage in the sulci of the brain, leave their cerebral beds for a short
and comparatively unprotected course, immediately previous to their
entry into the lacun&aelig; laterales of the superior longitudinal sinus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<p>In addition, he points to the very important fact that the localized
h&aelig;morrhages are commonly situated in relation to the mid-cerebral
cortex, close to the sinus, and on one or both sides of the falx cerebri.
In addition, therefore, to the symptoms of general cerebral compression,
certain definite localizing symptoms are to be observed, these
being in direct proportion to the size of the clot.</p>

<p>In an analysis of 74 autopsies on infants still-born or dying
within the first few days, Archibald<a id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
found &#8216;intrameningeal&#8217; h&aelig;morrhage
in 32, in 19 of which it was of considerable extent: and in
5 others there was extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage. In only two or three was
effused blood found within the cerebral cortex. The importance of
these facts from a surgical point of view cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptoms.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Besides the history of protracted labour and the
&#8216;blue&#8217; asphyxiated appearance of the baby, other evidence is to
hand with respect to both general and local increase of brain-pressure.</p>

<p>The <i>general</i> increase is evidenced first and foremost by the
bulging and non-pulsatile anterior fontanelle. The fontanelle may
be regarded as an index of intracranial pressure. The margins of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
fontanelle are outlined with some difficulty, and, owing to the free
communication between the intra- and extra-cranial venous systems,
the scalp-veins are unduly prominent. The general condition of the
child varies according to rise of intracranial pressure. In the more
serious cases it may be impossible to arouse the patient: in the
slighter h&aelig;morrhages the child may appear but little the worse,
with the exception, perhaps, of being rather more irritable than
usual.</p>

<p>The effect of the pressure on the medullary centres is shown by
respiratory difficulties&mdash;irregularities of rhythm, &amp;c.&mdash;some retardation
in pulse-rate, and increase in blood-pressure. The reflexes are
increased and the child is readily thrown into general convulsions.</p>

<p>The effect of the <i>localized</i> pressure on the upper Rolandic centres
seldom becomes evident till after the lapse of a few days&mdash;and often
after a longer period&mdash;when muscular weakness, twitchings, rigidity,
or paralysis&mdash;more especially of the contralateral lower extremity&mdash;becomes
apparent. The mother often draws attention to the fact
that the child does not move one of its legs properly.</p>

<p>When the extravasation is extensive, spreading downwards over
other motor areas, the upper extremities and even the face may be
involved.</p>

<p>When a small h&aelig;morrhage is present, situated on either side
of the falx cerebri, both lower extremities suffer and diplegia results.</p>

<p>In some cases, chemosis of the conjunction, &#339;dema of the lids,
and proptosis have been observed. In any case an ophthalmoscopic
examination should be carried out. Frequently some fullness of the
retinal veins and diminution in the calibre of the arteries supply
confirmatory evidence.</p>

<p>In the event of doubt in diagnosis, lumbar puncture should be
carried out. It should be noted, however, that although the positive
evidence of free blood corpuscles points to subdural h&aelig;morrhage,
yet that absence of blood in the fluid withdrawn does not exclude
the possibility of a localized and more or less encapsulated h&aelig;morrhage.
In the event of failure at recognition of the serious lesion
present, disastrous results will ensue&mdash;monoplegia, diplegia, hemiplegia,
epilepsy, and idiocy.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The age of the patient must not be allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
weigh in the balance against operative treatment, for, if due precautions
be taken, the new-born child stands operation well. Cushing
points out that &#8216;the possibilities of surgical relief are limited to the
first week or two after the h&aelig;morrhage has occurred, for old cortical
scars can neither be helped by medicine nor by the scalpel&#8217;.</p>

<p>The clot can be exposed by craniectomy or by craniotomy. The
latter operation results in a more complete exposure, but the shock
is undoubtedly more severe. Exposure by craniotomy is advocated
by Cushing, and carried out in the following manner: &#8216;An omega-shaped
incision just within the outer margin of the parietal bone is
carried down to the bone through the scalp and pericranium, and
the latter is scraped away so as to expose the thin serrated edge of
the parietal bone. Under this a blunt dissector is passed, so that the
edge of the bone is tilted up, and then, with a proper cutting instrument
(strong blunt-pointed scissors suffice), the bone is incised in
a line conforming with the skin incision 1 centimetre or more within
the parietal margin. The parietal bone is then broken across at its
base. The dura is opened by a curved incision some distance within
the bony margin, and the superficial clot broken away or lifted off
in fragments, or irrigated away with a gentle stream of warm saline
solution. The dura should be accurately sutured, the bone replaced,
and the skin closed with suture.&#8217;</p>

<p>He reports on 9 cases so treated, with 4 recoveries, apparently
complete and permanent. The fatal cases were all associated with
extensive extravasation over the entire hemisphere. In 3 cases
bilateral exposure was necessitated.</p>

<p>Taking, however, the question into more general consideration,
it would appear that equally satisfactory results can be obtained,
with a lesser degree of operative danger, by carrying out craniectomy
in the manner described in the treatment of &#8216;traumatic subdural
h&aelig;morrhage&#8217; (see <a href="#Page156">p. 156</a>).</p>

<h3>DERMOIDS</h3>

<p>Dermoids, in this region of the body, are almost invariably
situated in the middle line between nasion and inion, though cases
have been described in which congenital tumours, dermoid-like in
nature, were situated over the mastoid process and in other regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span></p>

<p>They occur with the greatest frequency over the anterior fontanelle
and in the region of the external occipital protuberance. In the
latter situation they are specially prone to possess those deep attachments
to the dura mater which are further alluded to below. In the
great majority of cases careful examination will show that the tumour
occupies a depression in the bone, saucer-like in nature, in which
the tumour rests. They are seldom freely movable, and are often
markedly fixed, being either attached to the pericranium or to deeper
structures. They are not attached to the overlying skin. The
tumour is irreducible, and pulsation is absent except in those rare
cases where, in the presence of a wide gap in the skull, transmitted
pulsation may be obtained.</p>

<p>On careful dissection it may be found that the tumour communicates,
by means of a small hole in the skull, with the underlying
membranes. In more exceptional cases a wide gap in the skull
may be found by means of which the dermoid obtains extensive
connexion with the dura mater and even with the brain. In rare
cases the dermoid may be pedunculated.</p>

<p>Bland Sutton drew attention to this frequent connexion between
the dermoid and the membranes of the brain, showing further that
the entire tumour may lie on the inner side of the occipital bone.</p>

<p>The following account affords further information as to the nature
and origin of cephalic dermoids.</p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>&#8216;Morphologically considered, the bony framework of the skull
is an additional element to the primitive cranium which is represented
by the dura mater, and the term extra-cranial should be applied to
all tissues outside the dura mater. Early in embryological life the
dura mater and skin are in contact; gradually the base and portions
of the side wall of the membranous cranium chondrify, thus separating
the skin from the dura mater. In the vault of the skull, bone developes
between the dura mater and its cutaneous cap, but the skin and dura
mater remain in contact along the various sutures even for a year
or more after birth. This relation persists longest in the region of
the anterior fontanelle and the neighbourhood of the inion. Should
the skin be imperfectly separated, or a portion remain persistently
adherent to the dura mater, it would act precisely as a tumour germ
and give rise to a dermoid. Such a tumour may retain its original
attachment to the dura mater, and its pedicle become surrounded
by bone; the dermoid would lie outside the bone but be lodged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
a depression on the surface, with an aperture transmitting its pedicle.
On the other hand, the tumour may become separated from the skin
by bone; it would then project on the inner surface or between the
layers of the dura mater. If this view of the origin of dermoids be
accepted, we must modify our teaching and say that the depressions
in which dermoids of the cranium are lodged arise as imperfections
in the developmental process, and are not due to absorption induced
by pressure; further, the fibrous connexion of such dermoids with
the dura mater is primary, not accidental.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">When of inconsiderable size, and when intracranial
connexions are absent, of doubtful existence, or of slight extent, the
sooner the tumour is removed the better. The dura mater should
not be opened unless absolutely necessary, in which case it should
be carefully sewn up and the scalp-flap replaced without drainage.</p>

<p>When possessing deep and extensive connexions, careful dissection
may still allow of the complete removal of the dermoid. It is
impossible to foretell with certainty whether it is possible to remove
the tumour until its basal portion is exposed. The operation may
be a formidable one.</p>

<h3>HYDROCEPHALUS</h3>

<p>The conditions that lead up to internal hydrocephalus are
classified by Parkes Weber<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
in the following <span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. &#8216;Cases secondary to and part of the phenomena of tuberculous
or any suppurative meningitis, comparable to pleural effusions due
to tuberculous or any septic invasions of the pleura.</p>

<p>2. Cases resulting from the presence of tumours, &amp;c., analogous
to the pleuritic effusions accompanying tumours, &amp;c., situated close
to or involving the pleura.</p>

<p>3. Ordinary infantile or congenital hydrocephalus, which is, in
some cases at least, due to intra-uterine meningitis.</p>

<p>4. Internal hydrocephalus supervening on the epidemic or
sporadic type of posterior basic non-suppurative meningitis.</p>

<p>6. Simple idiopathic internal hydrocephalus of adults or older
children due to serous ependymitis or ventricular meningitis.</p>

<p>7. Traumatic cases.&#8217;</p>

<p>This classification possibly includes all the various grades and
degrees of internal hydrocephalus, but for all practical purposes the
cases may be grouped into two classes, congenital and acquired, both
of which may be either acute or chronic.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Congenital internal hydrocephalus.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The condition may be
recognized soon after the birth of the child, or the enlargement of the
head may only become apparent some weeks or months later. The
slow development and the insidious nature of the enlargement, as
observed in many cases, may lead to some confusion between the late
congenital and the early acquired varieties. However, the absence of
any symptoms pointing to meningeal inflammation between the time
of the birth of the child and the hydrocephalic development usually
allows of correct classification.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether congenital internal hydrocephalus can be
ascribed to malformation of the inter-ventricular channels and
occlusion of the passages by means of which the cerebro-spinal fluid
escapes into the cerebral subarachnoid space, or whether the development
is dependent on hypersecretion from the ependyma and choroid
plexuses. Virchow showed that occasionally there was an actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
formation of small grey-red masses, about the size of a hemp-seed or
cherry, in the walls of the ventricles, but other authorities deny the
existence of such changes, and consider that the hydrocephalic condition
is entirely dependent on congenital malformation.</p>

<p>It would, however, seem more probable that we have to deal with
two distinct varieties of congenital internal hydrocephalus, one resulting
from intra-uterine ependymal inflammation (? syphilitic), the other
dependent on congenital malformations, especially in the region of the
fourth ventricle, where the foramina of Majendie, Key, and Retzius
are regarded as permitting the outward escape of the fluid secreted
from the lining membrane and choroid plexuses of the ventricles.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Acquired hydrocephalus.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Acquired hydrocephalus, whether
acute or chronic, presents certain antecedents or associations which
enable us to have a more clear idea as to the pathological conditions
present.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases it is secondary to basic meningitis
which, whether tuberculous or not, results in matting of membranes
and in the development of adhesions. The normal flow of cerebro-spinal
fluid from the ventricular to the cerebral subarachnoid spaces
is thus impeded.</p>

<p>Similar interference to the flow of cerebro-spinal fluid may be
caused by the growth of a tumour, especially those which originate
in the subtentorial region.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Progress of the case.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Whether the progress of the case be
acute or chronic, the ultimate results are much the same. The fluid
in the ventricular spaces may be increased up to 1,000 c.c. or more,
pressure effects being exerted on the surrounding parts, with the
following <span class="nowrap">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> The soft cerebral substance is slowly but surely compressed,
with the result that the sulci on the surface of the brain are more
or less obliterated, distinction between the white and grey matter may
be lost, the ventricular spaces are enormously dilated, and, in the most
marked cases, a mere shell of brain may intervene between the
ventricles and the surface of the brain.</p>

<p>This cerebral compression results in the development of two
main groups of symptoms, those referable to the general increase in
the intraventricular pressure and those due to regional compression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The more general results are headache, vomiting, optic neuritis
and atrophy, slow pulse-rate, somnolence, and coma. The temperature
is variable, more commonly rising during the more acute stages
of the disease, and falling to normal or subnormal during the quiescent
periods.</p>

<p>Localizing features are to be found in squints, inequality of
pupils, retraction of the head and neck, dyspn&#339;a, and dysphagia,
whilst compression of the cortical motor centres is evidenced by
twitchings, convulsions, and spasticity of the limbs. General convulsions
are by no means uncommon. Remissions and intermissions
of both local and general symptoms are frequently observed, paralyses,
for example, fluctuating in depth and character.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> The bones comprising the vault of the skull become greatly
thinned and widely separated from one another, the fontanelles
enlarged, and the sutures unduly prominent. The head becomes
enlarged in all directions, and its increased weight renders the child
incapable of retaining postural control, the head being top-heavy
and falling about in all directions.</p>

<p>The bones of the base share in the deformity. The pressure
exerted on the orbital plates of the frontal bone force the globe in
the downward direction in such a manner that the infra-corneal
sclerotic is obscured by the lower lid, whilst the supra-corneal portion
is unduly prominent. The bony eminences in the region of the sella
turcica are diminished in size, the middle fossa of the skull flattened
from side to side, and the posterior fossa from before backwards. In
such cases the skull assumes an almost dolicocephalic appearance.
In any case, the disproportion between the enlarged skull and
diminutive face is a marked feature.<a id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The scalp becomes stretched, hairs are sparse and brittle, and the
veins dilated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline following"><i>Indications for operation.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The results obtained
by operation for internal hydrocephalus are not sufficiently encouraging
to enable the surgeon to urge immediate operative treatment.<a id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Still, it is perfectly clear that he cannot possibly carry out surgical
treatment with benefit to the patient if the ventricular distension
is allowed to progress to such a degree that marked cortical flattening
and degeneration occurs. No fixed probationary period can be laid
down as a guide, each case must be judged on its own merits. Special
attention should be paid, however, to the disks and lower extremities.
Any suggestion of optic neuritis or spasticity should be regarded
as urgently demanding operative interference.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Lumbar puncture</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">cannot be expected to confer other than
temporary benefit even under the most favourable circumstances,
whilst, in the event of interference in the normal communication
between the ventricular and cerebro-spinal spaces, no relief can be
anticipated. Connal recommends that lumbar puncture should be
carried out daily, or twice daily, over extended periods of time. This
operation, however, is by no means devoid of danger, and the results
obtained by such treatment are not at all satisfactory.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Operations are carried out (<i>a</i>) with the object of
withdrawing fluid from the distended ventricular cavities (ventricular
puncture), and (<i>b</i>) to establish a communication, or short-circuit,
between the ventricular space and other spaces (ventricular drainage).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Ventricular puncture.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">This operation may be carried out through
the anterior fontanelle, through the frontal bone, or over the descending
cornu of the lateral ventricle.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Through the anterior fontanelle.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The region of the fontanelle is
shaved and cleansed in the usual manner, after which the surrounding
parts are cut off from the field of operation by a large sheet of gauze
or lint, in which a hole is cut sufficing to allow of exposure of the site
of election for puncture.</p>

<p>The patient should be in the recumbent position, the head well
towards the end of the table. The operation is performed without
an an&aelig;sthetic or under local an&aelig;sthesia. A site is chosen at the outer
angle of the fontanelle, about 1 inch away from the median antero-posterior
line, thus avoiding all possibility of injuring the superior
longitudinal venous sinus. The trocar and cannula, of small size,
is passed directly inwards, towards the base of the skull, for a distance
of not more than 2 inches. The trocar is withdrawn and the fluid
allowed to escape slowly. If the cerebro-spinal fluid escapes at high
pressure, the flow should be regulated by the finger placed over the
mouth of the cannula, and, in any case, it is inadvisable to allow
of the withdrawal of more than 50 c.c. (approximately 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ounces)
at one sitting. The cannula is withdrawn and the site of tapping
covered with collodion gauze. Even when adopting all precautions
the operation is not without danger, and, added to this, is the fact
that few surgeons care about introducing an instrument blindly into
the cerebral cortex&mdash;the risk of puncturing one of the distended
superficial cerebral veins is sufficiently obvious.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Through the frontal bone.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">Tillmanns, in recommending this procedure,
states that &#8216;the needle should be inserted about 2 centimetres
from the central line and 3 centimetres from the precentral sulcus.
You strike the ventricle at a depth of from 3 to 5 centimetres&#8217;. He
claims that this method leads to satisfactory results. It is open,
however, to all the objections of puncture through the fontanelle.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Over the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">This operation
is strongly recommended by Keen on the ground that excellent
drainage is supplied. A point is mapped out on the skull which lies
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches behind the external auditory meatus and the same distance
above Reid&#8217;s base-line. If the postero-lateral fontanelle be open<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
a small trocar and cannula may be introduced at the upper angle
of the space&mdash;thus avoiding the lateral sinus&mdash;and passed inwards
in a direction towards the summit of the opposite ear. If the fontanelle
be closed, a scalp-flap is framed and a bone-disk removed with a
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch diameter trephine. The dura should not be opened. The
evacuating instrument is then introduced through the membrane
in the same direction as before. In either case it should not be passed
for a greater distance than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, and, in all cases, the exploration
should be of a progressive nature, that is to say, the trocar should
be withdrawn once for each <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch of brain substance perforated.
The escape of cerebro-spinal fluid must be regulated in the manner
previously described.</p>

<p>If trephining has been necessitated, the bone-disk is not replaced,
thus allowing of subsequent tappings through the trephine-hole, this
gap now taking the place of a patent postero-lateral fontanelle.</p>

<p>Keen&#8217;s method of ventricular puncture presents many advantages
over other methods, though still open to the objection that the actual
central puncture is done blindly.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Ventricular-subdural drainage.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">A point is mapped out on
the scalp which corresponds to the surface-marking of the descending
horn of the lateral ventricle (see <a href="#Page3">p. 3</a>), and, with this point as a guide,
a scalp-flap is framed, the base of which lies immediately below the
indicated spot whilst its convexity is situated between 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> and 2 inches
above. This flap should not include the pericranium. The flap is
turned down to its base, the pericranium stripped aside and a disk of
bone removed, at the upper part of the exposed bone, with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> or
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch diameter trephine. The bone is usually very thin.</p>

introduced at the centre of the exposed brain, all visible vessels being
avoided. The diagnosis is now confirmed&mdash;by the withdrawal of the
trocar and the escape of cerebro-spinal fluid.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27. The Conversion of Hydrocephalus internus into Cephalocele.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>By the introduction of a bundle of horsehair or catgut, passed
through the cannula so as to project into the ventricular cavity, and,
after the withdrawal of the cannula, tucked, with respect to the
proximal ends, into the subdural, extra-dural, or subaponeurotic
spaces, it is obvious that drainage may be established between the
ventricles and the other regions. Experience showed, however, that
drainage into the subaponeurotic space usually converted the condition
of hydrocephalus into one of cephalocele (see <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>), the
fluid collecting as a localized fluid tumour over the region of exploration,
whilst extra-dural drains did not permit of sufficiently rapid
reabsorption of fluid. Subdural drainage gave the best results, the
cerebro-spinal fluid being brought into relation with the pia-arachnoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
meshwork of vessels. It would, of course, be infinitely preferable
if the ventricular fluid could be brought into direct relation with the
veins of the <i>subarachnoid</i> space, for the cerebro-spinal tension and
venous pressure are equal, and all excess of cerebro-spinal fluid would
be absorbed as soon as it is formed. This course is, however, impossible
to carry out. We have, therefore, to rest content with less
direct contact, drainage into the <i>subdural</i> space. This ventricular-subdural
drainage, as obtained by horsehair, catgut, and silk, apparently
leads to but temporary benefit, probably owing to falling
together of the brain substance and obliteration of the adventitious
passage.</p>

<p>Silver tubes and bone tubes have been utilized, but the results
are sometimes disappointing. In one of my recent cases the two
halves of a bone tube were utilized. The tube was cut across in an
oblique manner at about its centre, the two parts set at right angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
to one another and sewn together with silk. One arm is introduced
into the ventricle, the other tucked underneath the dura mater.
The child improved considerably, but the method is not altogether
satisfactory and by no means easy of application. In another case
I utilized strands of silver wire. The depth of brain-tissue necessary
to reach the ventricular cavity was measured, and two or three
strands of wire introduced so as to project well into that space, then
steadied with forceps whilst the proximal ends were bent at right
angles to the surface of the brain and tucked underneath the dura
mater. The method was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Tubular drainage is not essential, for the fluid escapes from the
ventricle as much alongside the tube as through its lumen. Still,
I believe that tubular drainage is preferable to other methods, and,
realizing the difficulty of introducing a right-angled tube&mdash;one arm
to project into the ventricle, the other to lie beneath the dura mater&mdash;Messrs.
Arnold &amp; Son are now making for me small and light right-angled
silver tubes so constructed that each limb can be inserted
independently, after which they can be locked together. This method
appears to overcome many of the difficulties previously encountered.
The tube is inserted after the formation of the osteoplastic flap,
as described above. The four dural flaps are then united, preferably
by cross union of their apices, the bone-flap is replaced, and the
scalp-flap sewn accurately into position. Collodion gauze, applied
to the wound, aids in the prevention of cerebro-spinal escape.</p>

<p>The scalp and bone-flaps are framed, and the dural incision
carried out low down, so as to make the opening to the brain as
valvular as possible. All these precautions are taken to avoid leakage
of cerebro-spinal fluid, a most troublesome complication&mdash;adding to
the risk of infection and often resulting in an acute eczematous
condition of the surrounding skin.</p>

<p>By this method it is hoped that a permanent fistulous communication
will be formed between the lateral ventricle and the subdural
space.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Ventriculo-abdominal drainage.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The following method of
drainage has been devised by Cushing: &#8216;It having been established
that the ventricle can be emptied by the lumbar route, and that the
withdrawal of fluid is not prejudicial to the child&#8217;s well-being, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
following procedure is carried out. A laparotomy is performed;
the posterior layer of peritoneum to the left of the rectum is split; the
body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, just under the bifurcation of the
vessels is exposed; the bone is trephined and one-half (the female
portion) of a silver cannula, exactly the size of the trephine, is inserted
and held in position. The child is then turned on his face and a
laminectomy performed; the subarachnoid space is opened, the
strands of the cauda separated, and the posterior half (male portion)
of the cannula is invaginated, so that it locks into the portion inserted
anteriorly. Both wounds are then closed. The fluid for a time finds
its way into the peritoneal cavity, but ultimately into the retro-peritoneal
space whence it is taken up by the receptaculum chyli, as
experimental observations have shown.&#8217;</p>

<p>Cushing has carried out this operation in 12 cases with a considerable
degree of success.</p>

<p>Recently, another method of treatment has been carried out by
Cotterill.<a id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> A large semilunar flap is made from the occipital region,
exposing the bone. Trephine circles are made on either side of the
median ridge, and the intermediate part of the bone, together with
the posterior part of the foramen magnum, is removed. The dura
mater is opened and the occipital sinus ligatured. The lateral lobes
of the cerebellum are then held apart, and the thickened arachnoid
over the posterior part of these lobes and over the roof of the fourth
ventricle exposed. This roof is opened. The wound is then closed.</p>

<p>By this method drainage from the ventricle is said to be reestablished.
Though without personal experience of this extensive
procedure, one cannot avoid expressing considerable doubt as to its
advisability.</p>

<p>My own experience would lead me to the following <span class="nowrap">conclusions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Whilst recognizing that internal hydrocephalus usually
demands surgical interference, it is only in some few cases that
material benefit results. Some recent successful cases point to the
possibility of better results in the future.</p>

<p>2. The operation which promises the best results, combined
with the least risk to the patient&#8217;s life, is that described as ventriculo-subdural
drainage.</p>

<p>It should be noted that enlargement of the head can only take place during
the years previous to synostosis of the skull bones. Leonard Guthrie (Harveian
Lecture, March 17, 1910) writes, &#8216;I cannot find from any recorded cases of hydrocephalus
acquired in later childhood and adult life that an increase in the size of
the head has been any aid to diagnosis, and I believe it is true that internal hydrocephalus
acquired after the sutures are set is hardly distinguishable from a non-localizable
intracranial new growth giving rise to headache, vomiting, and optic
neuritis.&#8217;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="chapname">FRACTURES OF THE SKULL</span></h2>

<h3 class="inline"><b>General considerations.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Fractures of the skull do not form
more than one-twentieth part of the fractures admitted annually
into the hospitals, but, in spite of this relative infrequency of occurrence,
the difficulties attendant on diagnosis, the numerous associated
complications, and the all-important question of treatment, invest
this subject with a special interest.</p>

<p>The whole question of skull fractures is beset with difficulties, many
of which, it is hoped, will be swept away in this and subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>Brief allusion must first be made to some important points in
connexion with the anatomical structure of the skull, such as bear
relation to fractures and aid in the appreciation of the extent and
mechanism of the fracture.</p>

<p>The <b>vault</b> varies in density to a remarkable degree, not only in
its several parts, but also in different individuals. Cases have now
and again been recorded in which a very trivial blow, totally insufficient
to produce any definite osseous lesion in the normal individual,
has resulted in the production of a vault or basic fracture. Each case,
therefore, must be judged on its own merits.</p>

<p>The vault derives its strength from its shape and structure. The
two tables are of equal strength, and, for the most part, separated
from one another by a variable amount of diploic tissue. This diploe
is most abundant in the frontal, parietal, and upper occipital regions.
These parts are proportionately strong. Two regions are practically
devoid of this inter-tabular buffer&mdash;the squamo-temporal and cerebellar
(see <a href="#Fig29">Figs. 29</a> and <a href="#Fig30">30</a>). A recognition of this comparative weakness
is of great practical importance in view of the fact that both these
regions are liable to special lesions&mdash;injury to the middle meningeal
artery in the first case, and, in the second, cerebello-medullary lesions.
Nature&#8217;s &#8216;mistake&#8217; in providing coverings unsuited to requirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
has been compensated for in part by additional protection&mdash;the
temporal and nuchal muscles.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig28">

<img src="images/illo069.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="593" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28. Diagram illustrating the Lines along which Forces received
on the Vault are transmitted to the Base.</span> (For further description, see text.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Further, not only does the skull vary in density in its several
parts, but it is also ribbed and strengthened by various bony bars
and buttresses that pass up from base to vault (see <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>).
These &#8216;ribbings&#8217; are seen to extend upwards from the crista galli,
from the external angular frontal process, from the auditory region,
and from the occipital protuberance. Presumably, these &#8216;ribbings&#8217;
were so constituted for a definite purpose; in any case, it is clear
that they play an important part in the reception and conduction
of forces to the base of the skull. It is apparent, moreover, that the
parts intervening between these &#8216;ribbings&#8217; are liable to injury in<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
direct proportion to their general position and strength. The deep
groovings of the bone for the reception of the middle meningeal artery
afford an additional source of weakness to the bone in the squamo-temporal
region. (See <a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29 b. The Base of the Skull as seen on Transillumination.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Further reference will be made to the relative strengths of the
various regions of the skull. Sufficient has been said to show that
nature has provided the skull with various paths by means of which
forces applied to the vault can be conducted and distributed to the base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span></p>

<p>Before, however, proceeding to discuss the effects produced on
the base of the skull, it is necessary to add that nature provides other
methods by means of which the intensity of a blow, delivered over
the vertex of the skull, is diminished. The forces are broken up and
distributed in the following <span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Though the force tends to travel in the direction of the applied
force, yet the convexity of the skull allows of the dissemination of
that force over a large superficial area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span></p>

<p>2. The intervention of cartilage or fibrous tissue between two or
more of the component bones of the vault tends to diminish the
intensity of the force, to break it up and to alter its direction.</p>

<p>3. The bony ridges, along which the forces tend to travel, themselves
terminate blindly (see <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>). Thus,</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Forces passing from the frontal region converge, more or less,
to the crista galli.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Forces from the external angular frontal process pass along
the wings of the sphenoid bone to the anterior clinoid process.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Forces from the auditory region are projected along the
summit of the petrous bone towards the apex of that process and to
the posterior clinoid process.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Forces applied to the occipital region travel inwards along
the internal occipital crest to the strengthened margins of the foramen
magnum, or are projected outwards along the lateral sinus ridges.
In the former case, the force either passes forwards towards the dorsum
ephipii and so again reaches the posterior clinoid process, or is
directed more laterally towards the jugular process of the occipital
bone, there meeting the fibrous tissue intervening between that
process and the corresponding part of the temporal bone.</p>

<p>4. All forces, whether transmitted along the internal occipital
crest, the temporal bone, the sphenoidal wings, or the crista galli
of the ethmoid, are further transmitted to the dura mater attached
to those prominences and ridges. The dura mater undoubtedly
plays an important part in the reception and transmission of the
forces.</p>

<p>5. The forces all show a tendency to converge towards the
pituitary region, the great &#8216;water-cushion&#8217; of the brain&mdash;a region
bounded by the clinoid processes. That these processes receive
a considerable part of the forces transmitted is confirmed by the fact
that they are frequently torn away from their basic attachments.
This is especially the case with respect to the attenuated base of the
anterior clinoid process.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that forces tend to be transmitted from
the vault to the base, and yet the base is, in many respects, the
weakest part of the skull. It is perforated by numerous foramina,
it is hollowed out in places for the formation of air sinuses and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
the reception of the integral portions of the auditory apparatus.
Furthermore, it presents a more or less plane surface, one differing
in all respects from the marked convexity of the vault. Those forces,
therefore, which are received by the base of the skull are not subjected
to that diffusion which forms so conspicuous a feature in the case of
the vault.</p>

<p>All these points tend to show that the base of the skull is more
or less unsuited for the reception of severe blows, direct or transmitted,
whilst, on the other hand, nature has taken into consideration
and provided fairly adequately against the dangers incident to vault
injuries.</p>

<p>It is not proposed at this stage to discuss further the relative
strength of vault and base. Points, other than those already enumerated,
will be brought forward in subsequent sections.</p>

<h3>FRACTURES OF THE BASE OF THE SKULL</h3>

<p>Fractures of the base of the skull are produced in two <span class="nowrap">ways:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. By violence applied <i>directly</i> to the base&mdash;perforating wounds
of the orbit, bullet-wounds through the mouth and base of skull,
the driving inwards of the bones of the face, the driving upwards
of the condyle of the jaw (the &#8216;knock-out&#8217; blow of the pugilist), and,
as the result of heavy falls on to the feet or buttocks, the upward
driving of the condyles of the occipital bone.</p>

<p>2. By violence applied <i>indirectly</i>&mdash;blows applied directly to the
vault and transmitted to the base. This variety will be considered
first as it receives the greatest prominence in surgical textbooks.
Various explanatory theories have been advanced, of which the
following are the more <span class="nowrap">important:&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>a</i>) <b>Aran&#8217;s theory of irradiation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">This theory states that
&#8216;fractures of the base result as extensions from fractures of the vault,
the fracture following the shortest anatomical route to the base&#8217;.
Although this theory must be accepted as offering a satisfactory
explanation for the occurrence of a certain proportion of basic
fractures, such, for instance, as result from a blow applied directly
to the vertex, it certainly cannot be accepted as accounting for the
great majority of basic fractures. The theory was advanced on the
hypothesis that basic and vault fractures were necessarily co-existent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
That combined lesions of this nature are frequently in evidence is
not to be doubted for one instant. It is, however, &#8216;putting the cart
before the horse&#8217; to say that the vault fracture is always the primary
lesion. Such is by no means the case.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <b>The bursting and compression theories.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The skull is
here regarded as an highly elastic sphere, compression of which leads
to diminution in the diameter along the axis of greatest pressure,
bulging occurring in other diameters. The bulging exceeding the
limits of elasticity a fracture occurs, the line of fracture varying
according to the different features present. Thus, when the lines of
fracture run parallel to the direction of the compressing force the bone
bursts open along the convexity (bursting fractures), and when the
lines of fracture run at right angles to the direction of the compressing
force a fracture by compression is said to result (compression fractures).</p>

<p>These theories are based on experiments carried out on the
cadaver, the skull being enclosed in a tight-fitting box and subjected
to pressure sufficing to bring about a fracture. Undoubtedly, the head
may be compressed between two forces, as, for instance, when a
person is knocked down in the street, the vehicle passing over the
head, or, as in a case recently under my care, where a boy, hanging
by his feet from the side of a barge, was crushed between the barge
and the wharf as the vessel swung inwards with the tide. Cases of
bilateral compression are, however, of infrequent occurrence, the
great majority of basic fractures resulting from blows applied directly
at the region of the level of the base of the skull (see <a href="#Page76">p. 76</a>), or from
the forward propulsion of the body, the head coming into violent
contact with a resisting object, as, for instance, when a person is
thrown out from a motor-car, the head striking against a tree, brick
wall, &amp;c. In the first case, there can be no question of bilateral
compression, and in the second the compression is exerted between
the vertex and the occipital condyloid region.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fundamental points on which the bursting and
compression theories are grounded are based on erroneous principles.
The skull cannot in any sense be regarded as a sphere, nor does it
possess the requisite elasticity to bulge and allow of compression
in the manner that the theory demands. The skull, in reality, forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
rather less than two-thirds of a sphere, the base passing inwards from
the lower limits of this partial sphere in a more or less horizontal
plane. This can be readily verified by placing the skull on a table
so that its base corresponds to the surface of the table. The elastic
properties of the skull have also been greatly exaggerated, and far
too little attention has been paid to the peculiar anatomical formation
of the base.</p>

<h4 class="inline">(<i>c</i>) <b>The contre-coup theories.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fractures of the base occasionally
occur in which evidence is conclusive that the blow was
received on the vault, the vault itself remaining uninjured. Such
cases have given origin to this theory, one stating that &#8216;from the
point struck a wave is transmitted through the semi-fluid brain,
producing a fracture at some more distant point&#8217;. Helferich, for
instance, maintains that isolated fractures of the orbital roof, and
more rarely of other parts of the base, are produced by the influence
of hydrostatic pressure. There can be no question that waves are
transmitted through the brain and cerebro-spinal fluid, but that such
waves should be capable of producing a basic fracture is, in my opinion,
beyond the bounds of possibility. The theory is opposed to all my
experience of basic fractures, and the cases brought forward in support
are capable of a much more probable explanation. The base is undoubtedly
the weakest part of the skull, and a blow on the vault
may fail to produce a local lesion and yet, when the force is transmitted
to the weaker base, may there bring about a more definite
result. For instance, it is by no means uncommon to find that a blow
on the frontal region fails to fracture the vertical plate of that bone
and yet suffices to produce a fracture, often comminuted, of the
orbital plate of the frontal bone or of the cribriform plate of the
ethmoid, two fragile plates, either of which may shatter like a plate
of glass from the effect of forces transmitted across them. In further
support of this theory, the following case, recently under my care,
may be cited. The patient received a heavy blow over the left
occipital region. A fracture passed inwards across the left cerebellar
fossa towards the posterior border of the foramen magnum, and a
second fracture, entirely distinct from the first, passed across the
right orbital plate of the frontal bone. In this case, the force conducted
across the base, from behind forwards, failed to fracture the<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
strong basi-occiput, but succeeded in producing a more definite lesion
on reaching the fragile orbital plate.</p>

<p>Some of the celebrated surgeons of the last century insisted that
the course pursued by basic fractures was to be explained on
anatomical grounds, but their views have been neglected and theories
based on experimental evidence have been accepted in their place.
All experiments, such as those previously mentioned, are useless, and
definite conclusions can only be gained by carrying out in every case
the following method of investigation: (1) by obtaining in the first
case an accurate history as to the manner in which the injury was
received; (2) by noting all visible and palpable signs of external
injury; (3) by careful observation of all the clinical symptoms during
the progress of the case; (4) by comparison of such with the lesions
found in case of death.</p>

<p>Over 300 cases have been investigated by me after these principles.
In about 30 per cent. of the cases sufficient evidence was
obtained to show that the basic fracture resulted and extended from
a primary fracture of the vault. These cases were to be explained
by Aran&#8217;s theory of irradiation. This theory, however, errs in stating
further that the fracture follows the shortest anatomical route to the
base. This is not correct, for the line of fracture corresponds to the
direction of the applied force and is influenced to a very large extent
by the resistance offered, the weaker areas being picked out and the
strong buttresses avoided. It is only in the most severe cases that the
fracture travels to and traverses across the base in such a direction
as to show that, for the time being, all laws are in abeyance.</p>

<p>In about 5 per cent. of cases the fracture resulted from bilateral
compression, from falls on to the buttocks, &amp;c., and from blows
applied to the angle of the jaw. These cases afforded examples of the
bursting and compression theories.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in over 60 per cent. of cases, the injury was
received over one of the following situations: (1) in front, over the
frontal eminence or supra-orbital ridges; (2) in the antero-lateral
region, over the external angular frontal process; (3) in the lateral
region, over the lower temporal, auricular, and mastoid regions;
(4) in the posterior region, over the superior curved line of the
occipital bone or over the external occipital protuberance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span></p>

<p>In all these cases, therefore, the blow was inflicted at or near the
level of the base of the skull, the resultant fracture being a fracture
by direct violence, the fracture traversing the base and splitting it
much in the same way as a chisel splits a board of wood. The &#8216;grain&#8217;
of the wood may be regarded as representing the weaker basic lines,
and any &#8216;knot&#8217; the resistance offered by the strong basic buttresses,
the forces being momentarily turned aside, but soon again passing
onwards, parallel to the original direction, but not necessarily in the
same straight line.</p>

<p>Any blow delivered at or near the basic level tends <i>primarily
to involve the weaker area, the base, passing secondarily upwards on to
the vault</i>. One may go even so far as to say that in most combined
vault and basic fractures, the vault fracture is a secondary development,
the basic fracture being the primary lesion.</p>

<p>There is, however, still another important anatomical feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
bearing on the mechanism of basic fractures, one that must necessarily
come into force in the greater number of such fractures. The base
of the skull may be said to consist of two parts, one lying anterior
to the condyles of the occipital bone, the other posterior to and
including the condyles with their vertebral attachment. These two
segments are united to one another by a weak chain&mdash;represented
by a line drawn from one external auditory meatus to the other,
with, as a connecting link, the sphenoidal sinus in the middle line.</p>

<p>When the base of the skull is viewed from below, it will be seen
that the weak line includes both Glaserian fissures, both petro-sphenoidal
sutures, both foramina lacera media, with the sphenoidal
sinus again as a connecting link. The two parts of the skull are, to
all intents and purposes, merely cemented together by the union
of the basi-sphenoid and basi-occiput. Consequently, if a blow be
received on the antero-lateral region of the head, the anterior segment
tends to be split off from the more fixed posterior part, the fracture
following the weak line previously indicated. This weak line occupies
so important a position in the mechanism of basic fractures that careful
observation will show that the greater number of middle fossa
fractures follow that line, wholly or in part. Such a fracture of the
middle fossa may be termed &#8216;the typical fracture of the base of the
skull&#8217; (see <a href="#Fig30">Figs. 30</a>, <a href="#Fig34">34</a> and <a href="#Fig39">39</a>).</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Summary of theories.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Aran&#8217;s theory of irradiation, with
certain modifications, accounts satisfactorily for about 30 per cent.
of basic fractures.</p>

<p>The contre-coup theory may be rejected entirely.</p>

<p>The bursting and compression theories are unsatisfactory,
accounting for not more than about 5 per cent. of fractures.</p>

<p>The majority of cases result from direct violence applied at or
near the basic level, the fracture passing across the base in the general
direction of the applied force, but not necessarily in the same straight
line.</p>

<p>Up to this point certain facts and theories have been discussed,
such as bear on the general mechanism of basic fractures. It now
remains to consider other factors that exercise influence on the general
direction of the fracture.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The influence of sutures on the line of the fracture.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
maceration of the skull is always essential in endeavouring to
estimate in what way the various sutures of the skull influence the
extent and direction of a fracture. Sutural separation is generally
regarded as of infrequent occurrence. An examination of a large
number of macerated skulls has shown, however, that sutural separation
is in reality of common occurrence. Certain sutures show a
special liability to such changes, especially the masto-occipital, the
petro-occipital, and the petro-sphenoidal. Separation of the sutures
is more common in the young adult; in the infant and in the old
such conditions are seldom observed.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the fact that forces transmitted
from the vault to the base, or vice versa, undergo a marked
diminution in intensity when the sutures of the skull are encountered,
the &#8216;fracture&#8217; showing a marked disposition to follow the line of the
suture. When the force is excessive, all rules are temporarily in
abeyance, but, under ordinary circumstances, the separation along
the line of a suture corresponds fairly accurately with the dentations
and serrations of the suture involved. Sutural separation without
actual fracture is a possible occurrence, but is decidedly rare. Such
isolated fractures are confined, more or less, to the sagittal suture in
the vault, and the masto- and petro-occipital sutures in the base.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The influence of air-sinuses, &amp;c., on the line of the
fracture.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The <i>sphenoidal sinuses</i>, two in number, are usually
separated from one another by a thin septum. This septum is, however,
often deficient, and a single cavity exists. The sinuses make
their appearance about the seventh or eighth year; they vary
greatly in size but, when fully developed, occupy the greater part
of the so-called body of the sphenoid, extending backwards almost
as far as the junction of the basi-sphenoid and basi-occiput, and
spreading outwards into the wings of the sphenoid and over the roof
of the orbit.</p>

<p>The sinus is bounded on all sides by a thin lamella of bone; its
roof forms part of the middle fossa of the skull, the sides are separated
by a thin bony wall from the cavernous venous sinus, and the floor
aids in the formation of the roof of the naso-pharynx. There exists,
therefore, in the very centre of the base of the skull&mdash;in the region
of the so-called buttress of connexion between the posterior and<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
anterior segments of the skull&mdash;an exceedingly weak area, one which
must be implicated in the great majority of basic fractures. The
&#8216;weak line&#8217; of the base of the skull&mdash;previously referred to&mdash;is now
still more accentuated.</p>

<p>The sphenoidal sinus is involved in at least 40-50 per cent. of
basic fractures, comminution of the sinus wall being often so excessive
that a probe can be passed with the greatest ease from the middle
fossa into the naso-pharynx. Blood is thus allowed to escape readily
into the naso-pharynx, and a source is opened up for the possible
development of meningeal infection.</p>

<p>Reference to the various illustrations of fractures of the base
will supply further evidence as to the special liability of the sinus
region to injury. It will be seen that nearly all fractures that pass
one middle fossa to the other, or from one middle fossa to the
opposite anterior fossa, traverse this region.</p>

<p>The <i>frontal sinuses</i>, also two in number, are separated from one
another by a thin osseous septum. Up to the age of puberty these
sinuses are either absent or represented by a small cell. Subsequently,
they develop rapidly, often extending into the orbital roof. The
upper and inner boundary&mdash;usually very fragile&mdash;assists in the
formation of the anterior fossa of the skull. The outer boundary&mdash;the
perpendicular plate of the frontal bone&mdash;is much more dense,
and, consequently, a fracture of the outer wall is almost necessarily
associated with a fracture involving the inner or orbital boundary,
that is to say with a fracture of the anterior fossa.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The ethmoid cells.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The ethmoid bone consists of a collection of
cells which communicate with the nasal cavity (middle and superior
meati), and which are merely separated from the anterior fossa of
the skull by the thin cribriform plate. This plate of bone is of so
fragile a nature that splintering occurs in the great majority of
anterior fossa fractures. The special dangers that arise from the
possibility of meningeal infection are obvious.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The auditory region.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">That part of the petrous bone which
encloses the auditory apparatus, and which transmits the seventh
and eighth pair of nerves, is proportionately weakened and correspondingly
liable to fracture. The special details of these fractures
are dealt with on <a href="#Page102">p. 102</a>.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>The influence of basic foramina.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">It has often been stated
that a basic fracture is arrested on meeting one of the larger foramina
of the skull. With this view I am not in agreement, for not only are
the larger foramina frequently involved, such as the foramen lacerum
posterium and medium, but the largest foramen of all, the foramen
magnum, is often implicated. It will be granted that certain foramina
are but rarely involved, but this is due to the fact that they are
aside of the chosen and definite paths of basic fracture. Thus, the
foramen ovale and the foramen spinosum are only exceptionally
involved because they lie immediately anterior to the petro-sphenoidal
suture, whilst the anterior condyloid foramen&mdash;transmitting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
hypoglossal nerve&mdash;is rarely implicated because it lies internal to
the usual posterior fossa fracture. On the other hand, the foramen
lacerum medium is involved in nearly every fracture that passes
from one middle fossa to the other.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The probable line of basic fracture in any given case.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">When the various weaker lines and areas are taken into consideration,
and when the direction and site of the applied force are known,
one is generally enabled to foretell with considerable accuracy the
probable transbasic course of the fracture. After investigating
over 300 cases, I was enabled to frame the following rules with
respect to the probable line of transbasic fracture.</p>

jugular foramen, being then continued on the other side of that foramen along the masto-occipital suture, and so again to the vault.</td>

evidence many interesting points. An inspection of the anterior aspect of the posterior fragment shows that the fracture passes just in
front of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, the ganglion being laid bare, whilst its petrosal branches are usually torn. The
fracture also passes anterior to the Eustachian tube and the horizontal part of the internal carotid artery. On examining this posterior
fragment the following structures will be seen, passing from without inwards: the posterior half of the external auditory meatus, the
mastoid antrum, the lacerated membrane and the ossicles of the middle ear, the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, the Eustachian

<h4 class="inline"><b>Summary.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Basic fractures tend to follow certain definite paths,
this transbasic course varying according to the direction of the force
applied and the site of application of the same. Whether the fracture
completely traverses the base depends on the character of the force
and the resistance offered, for bases, as well as vaults, vary greatly
in strength. To every rule there must be exceptions, and cases are
at hand in which the fracture appears to have obeyed no law, or in
which the force applied was of so forcible a nature that the fracture
traversed the base, regardless of all the ordinary rules.</p>

<p>The principles enumerated above were formulated by me some
four years ago, and, in spite of certain adverse criticisms, I am more
than ever convinced that the rules are correct, and that time and
research are alone required to add to the strength of my assertions.</p>

<h3>SYMPTOMS RESULTING FROM FRACTURE OF THE BASE OF THE SKULL</h3>

<p>The symptoms resulting from a fracture of the base of the skull
vary according to the particular fossa fractured. From a general
point of view, the following symptoms require <span class="nowrap">consideration:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>H&aelig;morrhages.</p>

<p>Escape of cerebro-spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Escape of brain-matter.</p>

<p>Escape of air from the air-sinuses into the surrounding tissues.</p>

<p>Involvement of certain cranial nerves.</p>

<h4 class="fullyleft"><b>Symptoms pointing to fracture of the Anterior Fossa.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline"><b>H&aelig;morrhages</b>:</h5>

<h6 class="inline following">(<i>a</i>) <i>Subconjunctival h&aelig;morrhage</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">usually makes
its appearance at the outer canthus of the eye, progressing inwards
towards the corneo-scleral margin, and, in the most severe cases,
completely surrounding the cornea, bulging the conjunctiva forwards
in such a manner as to constrict the field of vision. The extravasated
blood is usually bright red in colour, makes its appearance within
a few hours of the accident, and reaches its maximum within thirty-six
to forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>In some cases a condition of subconjunctival &#339;dema (chemosis)
is observed. This also usually originates at the outer canthus.</p>

<p>Taken by themselves, neither h&aelig;morrhage nor &#339;dema are of any
great diagnostic value. Both conditions, however, aid materially in
confirming the diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span></p>

<p>The blood is almost invariably completely absorbed, and no ill
effects remain.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <i>Palpebral and peri-palpebral h&aelig;morrhage</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">is seen in most cases
of fracture of the anterior fossa. This form of h&aelig;morrhage differs
from the one mentioned above in that it usually commences at the
inner canthus of the eye, thence progressing in the outward direction.
The extravasated blood may be wholly anterior to the suspensory
ligaments of the lid, in which case it may be surmised that the
fracture only involves the perpendicular plate of the frontal bone.
More commonly, however, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid shares
in the lesion, in which case palpebral, peri-palpebral, and subconjunctival
h&aelig;morrhage are all present.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>c</i>) <i>Orbital h&aelig;morrhages</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">may be so extensive that marked forward
protrusion of the globe exists. The time at which proptosis makes
its appearance, and the degree to which it progresses, vary according
to the nature of the lesion. <span class="nowrap">Thus:&mdash;</span></p>

</table>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>d</i>) <i>Retinal h&aelig;morrhages.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Fleming, in 1902, reported 12 cases of
fracture of the skull, all except one being fractures of the base, in
which retinal h&aelig;morrhages were present. All cases were associated
with h&aelig;morrhage into the subarachnoid space, and when this h&aelig;morrhage
was of a unilateral nature the retinal changes were likewise
one-sided. It was also found that in 4 cases of cerebral h&aelig;morrhage<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
without osseous lesion retinal h&aelig;morrhages were present in three,
these three being all associated with considerable effusion into the
subarachnoid space.</p>

<p>These observations are not only of value in the general diagnosis
of intracranial lesions, but are also of considerable importance in the
differential diagnosis between extra- and intradural h&aelig;morrhages.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>e</i>) <i>H&aelig;morrhage from the nose and mouth</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">is almost invariably
present in fractures of the anterior fossa, with the inference that the
fracture involves the cribriform plate. The blood&mdash;derived mainly
from lacerated ethmoidal vessels&mdash;escapes from the anterior nares or,
passing back into the naso-pharynx, escapes by the mouth or is
swallowed, to be vomited up later.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Escape of cerebro-spinal fluid.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Blandin, of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu,
drew attention to this condition in the year 1840. The fracture
involves the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and is associated with
laceration of the overlying dura mater and arachnoid, and of the
prolongations of those membranes along the olfactory nerves.</p>

<p>The escape of cerebro-spinal fluid from the nose may be regarded
as diagnostic of a fracture of the anterior fossa, in spite of the fact
that Goucard, Malgaigne, and others describe cases in which, as the
result of a severe fracture of the petrous bone (middle fossa) without
laceration of the membrana tympani, the fluid escaped along the
Eustachian tube to be expelled by mouth and nose.</p>

<div class="details">

<p>At this stage, it will be necessary to allude more fully to the
general question of cerebro-spinal discharge from the nose, mouth,
and ear. The symptom is an important one, though undoubtedly
of far less frequent occurrence than stated in text-books. This was
proved by Crandon and Wilson, who reported 27 cases in which there
was a cerebro-spinal discharge out of a total number of 530 cases
examined. Phelps mentions 13 in a series of 286 cases of fractured
base. My experience coincides with these statements.</p>

<p>The escape of a slightly blood-stained fluid from the ear and
nose does not necessarily imply that the fluid is cerebro-spinal in
nature, for it has been proved on numerous occasions that fluid may
escape in considerable quantities without the existence of a basic
fracture. In such cases the fluid is derived either from the membranous
labyrinth (the liquor cotunnii) or from the mucous
membrane lining the ear and nose, the result of great vaso-motor
dilatation of aural and nasal vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span></p>

<p>If the fluid be cerebro-spinal in nature, the natural inference is
that the subarachnoid space is opened up to the exterior, either
directly or indirectly along the course of a cranial nerve. A chemical
analysis of the fluid will determine the nature thereof, provided that
the fluid be collected <span class="smcap lowercase">EARLY</span>.</p>

<table class="columns" summary="Fluid">

<tr>
<td class="text">Thus, cerebro-spinal fluid is rich in chlorides, contains little or no albumen, but shows a trace of a reducing
substance, allied to pyro-catechin,</td>
<td class="center top padl2 padr2">whilst</td>
<td class="text">fluid derived from other sources contains chlorides, a fair amount of albumen, and no sugar.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Certain factors, however, must be taken into consideration
which diminish the value of these chemical tests, for, though the fluid
be cerebro-spinal in nature, the admixture of blood at once interferes
with the delicacy of the test. Furthermore, even in the event of
a profuse discharge of cerebro-spinal fluid, the first part collected
alone contains sugar, the discharge soon becoming nothing more or
less than a serous exudation.</p>

<p>The fluid is almost certainly cerebro-spinal if the discharge begins
within twenty-four hours of the accident, if it be practically colourless,
fairly profuse, and continuing for two or three days, perhaps longer.</p>

<p>Though the discharge usually originates early, cases are recorded
in which the flow commenced some weeks after the accident. The
discharge may continue for hours or for weeks. Sir W. Savory
recorded a case in which fluid escaped for one month from both ears.
The quantity also varies greatly, usually a few ounces, but sometimes
many pints. Sir W. MacCormac recorded a case in which 10 pints
escaped within five hours. A profuse discharge is due to the fact that,
as the original cerebro-spinal fluid drains away, its place in the subarachnoid
space is taken by a serous exudation from the cerebral
venous system. This exudation occurs as soon as the subarachnoid
pressure is sufficiently reduced, the serous exudation progressing till
the venous and cerebro-spinal pressures are again equal.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>prognosis</i>, it is interesting to note that the escape
of cerebro-spinal fluid implies of necessity that the subarachnoid
space is opened up to the exterior, with all attendant dangers of
meningeal infection, yet that the prognosis is generally favourable.
One might even go further and state that the prognosis in such cases
is rather more favourable than under more ordinary circumstances.
Thus, Battle records 36 cases with a mortality of 25 per cent., the
general mortality of fractured base being about 44 per cent. My
own experience tallies with these statistics. The more favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
result hinges no doubt on the fact that the prolonged outflow tends
to wash away organisms existent in the aural and nasal passages.</p>

<p>With regard to any special points in treatment, it is obvious that
syringing of ear or nose is absolutely contra-indicated. The cavities
should be <i>lightly</i> plugged with gauze, the dressings to be renewed
as soon as they are soaked. The patient must also be prevented from
interfering with the dressings.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Escape of brain-matter from the nose.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">This diagnostic
symptom is of very rare occurrence. For its development the following
factors are <span class="nowrap">requisite:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Great comminution and destruction of the anterior fossa.</p>

<p>Severe local laceration of the brain (frontal lobes).</p>

<p>A copious discharge of blood and cerebro-spinal fluid.</p>

<p>A general increase in the intracranial pressure.</p>

<p>One case only of this nature has come under my own observation,
that of a man whose right nostril was blocked with brain substance.
He died shortly after admission into the hospital, and at the post-mortem
examination the above conditions were found.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Escape of air from the air-sinuses into the surrounding
regions.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">When the fracture involves the frontal, ethmoidal, and
mastoid sinuses, any sudden increase of the intrasinus air-pressure,
such as is caused by sneezing, blowing of the nose, &amp;c., may force
air into the surrounding tissues. A distinction must be made between
those cases in which the pericranium overlying the seat of fracture
is torn and those in which it remains intact. In the former case,
the escaping air may spread widely into the neighbouring loose
tissues, leading to a condition of &#8216;surgical emphysema&#8217;. In the
second case, the air remains confined to a smaller area, giving rise
to a soft, more or less rounded swelling. Gentle palpation of this
swelling imparts to the fingers that crackling sensation peculiar to
the condition. Firm pressure results in diminution in the size of the
tumour, the contained air being forced back into the sinus cavity.
Such localized collections of air are known as &#8216;pneumatoceles&#8217;.</p>

<p>As regards the special <i>treatment</i> of these conditions, the patient
must, in the first case, be warned against straining of all sorts.
Pneumatoceles require no other treatment. The condition soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
disappears if the patient recovers. In widespread surgical emphysema,
an incision should be made over the injured sinus, thus
allowing of the direct escape of the air expelled from that sinus.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The involvement of nerves.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The following nerves may be
involved in anterior fossa <span class="nowrap">fractures:&mdash;</span></p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>a</i>) <i>The olfactory nerve.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The great majority of anterior fossa
fractures traverse the cribriform plate, necessarily injuring the fine
branches of the olfactory bulb. The bulb itself may be lacerated,
with or without injury to the under surface of the frontal lobes.
Sir Prescott Hewitt considered that anosmia, or loss of smell, resulted
most frequently from blows applied to the back of the head, the frontal
region being injured by contre-coup. From my own experience it
would appear, however, that anosmia, whether uni- or bilateral,
whether transient or permanent, generally results from direct injuries
of the cribriform plate with associated lacerations of the olfactory
nerves. It is difficult to estimate the presence or degree of immediate
loss of smell on account of the general condition of the patient and
because the nostrils are usually more or less filled with blood
coagulum. Experience shows, however, that early loss of smell is
the rule and total and permanent anosmia the exception. Anosmia
is usually associated with some degree of loss of taste.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <i>The optic nerve.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Many cases have been recorded in which
visual defects resulted from blows applied to the head. The blindness
may be partial or complete, immediate in onset or developing at some
future date. In the latter case, the loss of vision is due to retinal
changes or results from post-neuritic atrophy.</p>

<p>The occurrence of complete or partial blindness as the immediate
result of the injury is, at first sight, difficult to explain, for the vast
majority of anterior fossa fractures avoid the immediate vicinity of
the optic foramina, passing by preference between the two foramina
or diverging towards the sphenoidal fissures. Small fissured fractures
not infrequently radiate through the optic foramina, usually, however,
of so slight a nature as to be incapable of leading to any gross lesion
of the optic nerves. H&aelig;morrhage into the sheath of the nerve is
probably responsible for a certain proportion of cases, more especially
those in which there is a peripheral concentric loss of vision, the more
central fibres escaping. It is possible, also, that cases evidencing<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
temporal or nasal blindness may be due, as J. J. Evans<a id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> thinks, to
a contre-coup contusion of the nerve through it being forcibly driven
against the bony boundaries of the foramen. Taking into consideration,
however, the very frequent presence of a fracture through the
anterior clinoid process (see <a href="#Page82">p. 82</a>), and the usual displacement of
that process, it would appear probable that immediate and more or
less complete loss of vision results from the compression and crushing
of the optic nerve by reason of the pressure exercised by a displaced
clinoid process.</p>

<p>The following statistics add confirmation to this view. Thus,
Callen collected 17 cases in which the optic nerve was compressed
by osseous fragments in the region of the optic foramen, whilst
Holder observed injury to the bones entering into the formation
of the foramen in 53 out of 86 cases of fracture involving this
region.</p>

<p>The prognosis varies according to the cause of the blindness.
When resulting from concussion of the nerve trunk or from h&aelig;morrhage
into its sheath, certain fibres may regain their function. In the
majority of cases, however, that have come under my own observation,
blindness of the affected eye was immediate and permanent.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>c</i>) <i>The nerves passing through the sphenoidal fissure.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The
ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve is rarely injured to such a degree
as to cause an&aelig;sthesia of all the regions supplied. Blood extravasation
into the surrounding regions, or direct involvement of one
of the branches of the nerve, often results in areas of an&aelig;sthesia, and
some few cases have been recorded in which there was complete
an&aelig;sthesia of both cornea and conjunctiva, with subsequent ulceration
and sloughing. The nasal nerve may be implicated as the result
of a fracture involving the cribriform plate, whilst the supra-orbital
and supra-trochlear branches may be damaged by fractures of the
vertical plate of the frontal bone.</p>

<p>The third nerve is similarly liable to injury, in any part of its
orbital course. It is quite exceptional, however, for the whole trunk
to be affected, some of the branches being taken, others left. The
fourth nerve is also occasionally involved, generally in association
with other orbital nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span></p>

<p>When an&aelig;sthesia or paralysis of muscles results from pressure
exercised on the nerves by extravasated blood, the ultimate prognosis
is not unfavourable. When due to direct implication, in the line of
the fracture, the prognosis is much more uncertain, partial or complete
loss of function resulting.</p>

<h3>SYMPTOMS POINTING TO FRACTURE OF THE MIDDLE FOSSA</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>External h&aelig;morrhages.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline following">(<i>a</i>) <i>H&aelig;morrhage into the temporal
region.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The extravasated blood may either be confined to the
temporal region&mdash;temporal h&aelig;matoma&mdash;or diffused throughout the
subaponeurotic space. A temporal h&aelig;matoma is always highly
suggestive of a fracture involving the temporal fossa, especially in
the event of marked outward bulging, with stretching and discoloration
of the overlying tissues. In many cases also the h&aelig;matoma
pulsates, in which case it can be presumed that the fracture
of the temporal fossa is associated with h&aelig;morrhage from a lacerated
middle meningeal artery (see <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>). In such cases the application
of pressure to the h&aelig;matoma may lead to the development of fits
on the contra-lateral side, originating in the face or arm regions and
spreading to the higher cortical motor area.</p>

from the Ear.</span> A, The fracture the roof of the external auditory meatus.
B, Comminution of the tegmen tympani, the fracture involving the groove for the
posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>H&aelig;morrhage from the ear and mouth.</i> The great majority of
middle fossa fractures involve the external auditory meatus, passing
inwards across the roof and floor of the middle ear towards the body
of the sphenoid. Examination will show that the fracture passes
inwards towards the junction of the inner and anterior walls of
the middle ear, that is to say, towards the tympanic orifice of the
Eustachian tube. The membrana tympani undergoes a variable degree
of destruction. In the lesser cases the membrane is torn in its upper
and front part only&mdash;in the region of the membrane of Shrapnell&mdash;whilst
in the more serious cases it may be completely destroyed.
The blood that escapes from the ear is derived from those vessels
that supply the lining cuticle of the external and middle ears, from the
numerous tympanic vessels, from the lateral sinus, and from the middle
meningeal artery. The amount of blood which escapes varies according
to the source of the h&aelig;morrhage. When h&aelig;morrhage occurs from
the smaller vessels, the blood either clots in the external meatus or
trickles from the ear. In the most severe cases the h&aelig;morrhage is<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
profuse and long-continued. Some years ago a case came under my
observation that threw light on the probable source of such severe
h&aelig;morrhages.</p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>A man was admitted into the hospital, suffering from profuse
h&aelig;morrhage from the ear as the result of a fall down an area. The
bleeding continued for fourteen hours, soaking the dressings and
continuing so long as the man lived. At the post-mortem examination
an extensive comminution of the tegmen tympani was discovered,
the fracture being associated with great extra-dural extravasation
of blood from a lacerated middle meningeal artery. The extra-dural
h&aelig;morrhage was enabled to escape through the tegmen tympani into
the middle ear, and thence by means of the lacerated membrana
tympani (see <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>).</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>Profuse and long-continued h&aelig;morrhage from the ear should
always arouse suspicion as to the possibility of injury to the middle
meningeal artery. Since meeting the case recounted above, many
similar cases have come under my care, and, in several instances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
guided by this symptom alone, operative measures have been carried
out successfully.</p>

<p>The two following cases show, however, that the extra-dural
extravasation may be derived not only from the middle meningeal
artery but also from the lateral sinus.</p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>&#8216;A man fell down an area and suffered from continuous h&aelig;morrhage
from the ear. He remained in bed for a few days, and then,
becoming tired of confinement, got up, walked some distance on
a cold and frosty day, and visited a <i>sage femme</i>. On returning
home he complained of feeling ill, the h&aelig;morrhage from the ear
ceased, and shortly afterwards he became unconscious and died.
The autopsy showed an extensive fracture of the petrous bone with
extensive extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage from a torn lateral sinus and from
a lacerated meningeal artery.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The man had remained fairly well so long as the extra-dural
blood was permitted a free means of escape through the tegmen
tympani and external auditory meatus, but, so soon as clotting
occurred, compression symptoms developed and the man died in that
condition.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<div class="casestudy">

<p>&#8216;A man, 50 years of age, fell down, striking his head against
the kerb. On admission it was seen that blood was trickling freely
through a torn membrana tympani. He rapidly became unconscious
and died. The post-mortem examination revealed a fracture involving
the middle ear and external auditory meatus, passing backwards
across the lateral sinus, in which region there was a large extra-dural
extravasation of blood.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>The above statements are confirmed by Dwight,<a id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who, in 146
autopsies, found that, in 69 per cent. cases of fracture of the middle
fossa of the skull, there was bleeding from the ear, and that in
29 per cent. cases the fracture was associated with laceration of
branches of the middle meningeal artery.</p>

<p>Although h&aelig;morrhage from the external auditory meatus may
be regarded as almost diagnostic of a middle fossa fracture, especially
of that variety previously described as the &#8216;typical basic fracture&#8217;,
yet the blood may be derived from a torn membrana tympani or
from laceration of the lining cuticle of the external meatus. Aural<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
examination will soon prove whether the blood is coming through
a rent in the membrane, in which case the diagnosis is clear. Sometimes
bleeding takes place from both ears, a symptom practically
diagnostic of the transverse middle fossa fracture known as the
&#8216;typical basic fracture&#8217;.</p>

<p>The following statistics will supply further information as to the
relative frequency with which h&aelig;morrhage occurs from ears, nose,
and mouth, and the proportionate mortality. The cases were collected
and tabulated by Crandon and Wilson.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Special points in prognosis and treatment.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">It is not possible to
formulate any very definite prognosis when the h&aelig;morrhage takes
place from one ear only, though the mortality is about 40 per cent.
When bleeding takes place from both ears the outlook is more grave,
the mortality being about 66 per cent.</p>

<p>With regard to special treatment, two points are obvious:
(1) that syringing of the ear is absolutely contra-indicated, on the
ground that such treatment carries with it a considerable risk of
bringing about meningeal infection; and (2) that plugging the external
meatus with strips of gauze is an unsurgical form of treatment,
insomuch as the escape of blood from the ear is an important factor
in preventing compression of the brain, more especially in those cases
where h&aelig;morrhage is profuse. Under the last named conditions,
operative measures&mdash;exploration for a torn meningeal artery or
lacerated venous sinus&mdash;are to be carried out.</p>

<p>H&aelig;morrhage from the mouth may be slight or copious, according
to the source from which the blood is derived. In the former case,
the bleeding takes place from sphenoidal and pharyngeal vessels, in
the latter from the cavernous sinus or from the internal carotid artery
(see <a href="#Page148">p. 148</a>), the bone being shattered in the region of the sphenoidal
body, with comminution of the walls of the contained air-sinus.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Escape of cerebro-spinal fluid.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">This condition was first<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
investigated by Van der Wiel in 1727, and more completely by
Langier in 1839. The majority of those middle fossa fractures which
involve the petrous portion of the temporal bone pass immediately
anterior to the genu of the facial nerve (see <a href="#Page102">p. 102</a>), and it follows,
therefore, that the fracture cannot so involve the dural and arachnoid
prolongations of that nerve in such a manner as to allow of the escape
of cerebro-spinal fluid. This fact probably explains another fact,
namely, that aural cerebro-spinal discharge is an infrequent symptom
in middle fossa fractures. On the other hand, as a result of blows
applied to the occipital region, a fracture originating in the posterior
fossa may cut across the petrous bone, almost at right angles, in such
a manner as to sever the seventh nerve in the region of the genu
(see <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>). This is the usual nature of a basic fracture associated
with the escape of cerebro-spinal fluid from the external auditory
meatus. More rarely, this particular class of fracture is unaccompanied
by any injury to the tympanic membrane, in which case the
fluid may escape along the Eustachian tube into the nose and naso-pharynx
(see <a href="#Page91">p. 91</a>). Cerebro-spinal fluid may also escape from the
nose and mouth in middle fossa fractures in the event of extensive
injury to the basi-sphenoid with involvement of the overlying
cisterna basalis. The following case exemplifies that <span class="nowrap">condition:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>A man suffered from a severe fracture of the middle fossa. Three
weeks later there was a sudden and profuse discharge of cerebro-spinal
fluid from the nose. Meningitis developed and the patient died.
The basi-sphenoid was extensively comminuted, the overlying membranes
torn, whilst a probe could be passed readily from the cranial
cavity into the naso-pharynx.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<h5 class="inline"><i>Special points in prognosis and treatment.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The question of
cerebro-spinal discharges has been discussed previously (see <a href="#Page91">p. 91</a>).
It is therefore merely necessary to lay further stress on the fact that
syringing of the ear is absolutely contra-indicated, for reasons already
stated. The ear should be cleaned out with wool and gauze and
<i>lightly</i> packed with strips of gauze, these to be renewed when soaked
with fluid. When the cerebro-spinal discharge is long continued,
acute eczema of the side of the neck may develop as a result of the
irritating effect of the fluid. Under these circumstances it is advisable
to adopt precautionary measures, painting the skin with &#8216;new ski<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>n&#8217;
or collodion. Ointments are of but little use. The eczema will clear
up so soon as the discharge ceases.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Escape of brain-matter.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The conditions needful for the
discharge of brain-matter from ear or nose have been enumerated
previously (see <a href="#Page93">p. 93</a>). There are but few cases recorded in literature,
and one case only has come under my own <span class="nowrap">observation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>A lad, 11 years of age, fell some distance out of window on to
his head. He was admitted under the care of my colleague, Mr. Lockwood.
On admission he was unconscious, and was bleeding freely
from the right ear and nose. Shortly afterwards it was noticed that
brain-matter was issuing from the right external auditory meatus,
sufficient brain-matter being obtained to fill a teaspoon. The extensive
nature of the brain-injury was confirmed by the fact that the
left arm and leg were paralysed for some days. On the fourth day
the boy regained consciousness and recognized his relations. From
this period onwards he made an uninterrupted recovery. I have
seen the lad on various occasions, the last time one year after the
accident. At that time he was an exceedingly bright and intellectual
boy.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<h5 class="inline"><i>Special points in treatment and prognosis.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The brain-matter
should be gently wiped away from the ear, and the meatus cleansed
and lightly plugged with gauze. Operative measures are required
in the event of the development of symptoms pointing to brain
compression. The prognosis must necessarily be unfavourable, but,
as the conditions are almost entirely confined to the young, the most
astonishing recoveries are reported.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Involvement of nerves.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The second and third divisions of
the fifth nerve pass respectively through the foramen ovale and the
foramen rotundum, two foramina which lie anterior to the petro-sphenoidal
suture, a suture traversed by the majority of middle
fossa fractures. These two nerves are therefore seldom involved.</p>

<p>In all the cases of fractured base which have come under my
observation I have never seen the foramen rotundum implicated,
and in one case only was the foramen ovale involved.</p>

<p>In certain rare instances, a fracture, passing in the antero-posterior
direction, may cut across the apex of the petrous bone in
close relation to the cavum Meckelii&mdash;the bed of the Gasserian ganglion&mdash;in
which case all three terminal divisions of the fifth nerve may<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
suffer. Thus, a case was reported by Lee in 1853 in which, seven
weeks after the accident, the following symptoms were present:&mdash;an&aelig;sthesia
of the left face and forehead, anterior two-thirds of
tongue, and left nostril, together with weakness of the left masticating
muscles, and an opaque left cornea.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The sixth nerve.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The sixth nerve may be involved either by
itself or in conjunction with other cranial nerves. In the latter case
the paresis is due to blood extravasated in the sphenoidal fissure or
in the orbital cavity. In the former case the nerve is injured where
it grooves the lateral aspect of the dorsum ephipii, a process frequently
fractured in lesions of the middle fossa. Fractures tend to
pass obliquely across this process, one nerve usually escaping. The
prognosis as to functional recovery is very problematical.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The seventh and eighth nerves.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">There can be no doubt that the
seventh nerve, on account of its complicated intrapetrous course, is
more frequently involved than any other cranial nerve. K&ouml;hler
records 22 cases in 48 middle fossa fractures. My own experience
coincides closely with K&ouml;hler&#8217;s, facial paresis or paralysis being noted
in nearly 50 per cent. cases of middle fossa fracture.</p>

<p>The question of facial nerve implication is so intimately associated
with involvement of the eighth nerve that the two subjects
must be considered together. Thus, cases may be classified as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore05">1. Cases of paresis of the facial nerve with a variable degree
of deafness.</p>

<p class="blankbefore05">2. Cases of complete facial paralysis with complete deafness.</p>

<p class="blankbefore05">The greater number of middle fossa fractures involve the middle
and external ears, as is evidenced, amongst other symptoms, by
h&aelig;morrhage from the ear. Some degree of facial paralysis is frequently
existent, not always evident at first sight, but requiring
careful examination and comparison between the two sides of the
face. The fracture involves both roof and floor of the external ear
and passes inwards towards the junction of anterior and inner walls
of the middle ear, the membrana tympani undergoing a variable
degree of destruction whilst the ossicles may also be injured. Thence,
the fracture passes inwards towards the petro-sphenoidal suture in<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
such a manner that the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve is
exposed and laid bare on the anterior aspect of the posterior portion
of the skull.</p>

<p>The facial nerve, therefore, escapes direct injury except in so far
that the ganglion may be compressed by blood-clot or fragments
of bone. Partial loss of function results. In most cases the blood
is absorbed and a complete recovery may be anticipated. The degree
of deafness is directly proportionate to the damage incurred by the
membrana tympani and ossicles.</p>

<p>In the second group of cases a different picture is obtained.
Usually the result of blows applied to the occipital region, the fracture<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
traverses the thin cerebellar fossa towards the outer angle of the
jugular foramen, thence cutting across the petrous bone, external to
the internal auditory meatus, and terminating, usually by comminution,
in the tegmen tympani. It is in the transpetrous part of
the fracture that the damage is done, for, not only is the facial nerve
cut across in the region of the ganglion, but the auditory apparatus
is also severed into two parts. The exact line of the fracture is shown
in <a href="#Fig40">Figs. 40</a> and <a href="#Fig41">41</a>.</p>

<p>In this class of fracture, though facial paralysis and deafness are
both immediate in onset and permanent in duration, there is, in many
cases, no bleeding from the ear as the membrana tympani may be
uninjured.</p>

<p>The facial nerve may also be implicated in that rare type of
basic fracture which was described by L&egrave;on Boullet in 1878, under
the title of &#8216;Fracture of the Mastoid portion of the Temporal bone&#8217;.
This fracture is fully described on <a href="#Page108">p. 108</a>. It will suffice
to mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
that the mastoid process may be torn away from the base of the
skull, the facial nerve being lacerated as it descends the aqueductus
Fallopii.</p>

<p>Bilateral facial paralysis is exceedingly rare. Two cases were
described by the late Professor von Bergmann. Its occurrence is
pathognomonic of the typical basic fracture (see <a href="#Page84">p. 84</a>).</p>

<h3>SYMPTOMS POINTING TO FRACTURE OF THE POSTERIOR FOSSA</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>External h&aelig;morrhages.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In fractures of the posterior fossa,
blood effused into the deeper tissues of the scalp has considerable
difficulty in coming to the surface and thus making itself evident.
Furthermore, the resistance offered by the nuchal muscles tends to
confine the blood to the subtentorial region, thus adding to the already
grave prognosis of fractures in this region. On careful palpation,
however, it will be noted that the nuchal tissues present a doughy or
boggy condition, whilst ecchymosis becomes evident after twenty-four
to thirty-six hours. A peculiar ecchymotic patch is occasionally
observed, appearing in front of the mastoid process and travelling
upwards in a curved direction, concavity forwards, following the
outline of the ear. It is said to result from the tracking of blood
along the course of the posterior auricular artery. Whether this is
the case or not, the h&aelig;morrhage usually implies a separation along
the line of the masto-occipital suture.</p>

<p class="hinline">When dealing with fractures of the
middle fossa, allusion was made to the implication of the seventh and
eighth pair of nerves as the result of a fracture traversing the posterior
fossa of the skull towards the outer angle of the jugular foramen and
cutting across the petrous bone (see <a href="#Page104">p. 104</a>).</p>

<p>The ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves may be injured
in the same variety of fracture. These three nerves are, however, so
protected by their dural sheaths that they generally escape
injury.<a id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In the following cases the nerves were <span class="nowrap">involved:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>The patient was admitted suffering from a fracture resulting
from a blow on the posterior parietal region. During the next four

<p>In another case the patient was admitted with a fractured base.
He progressed favourably until the tenth day when, on sitting up
suddenly in bed, he was seized with rigors, dyspn&#339;a, and dysphagia,
dying shortly afterwards. A basic fracture was found, practically
dividing the skull into two parts and involving the jugular foramen.
Displacement had occurred with consequent compression of the
ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves.</p>

were injured, with inability to speak or swallow, paralysis of the right

<h3>FRACTURE OF THE MASTOID PORTION OF THE TEMPORAL BONE</h3>

<p>Fractures limited to this region are of rare occurrence. Our
knowledge of the condition is obtained from the researches of L&egrave;on
Boullet, who first described the fracture in 1876, reporting at the
same time 26 cases.</p>

<p>The fracture usually results from sharp blows delivered along the
posterior border of the mastoid process, the force acting obliquely
from above downwards and forwards. More rarely, the process is
detached as the result of a blow delivered immediately above
the ear, that organ sharing in the displacement. In either case
the detachment is usually of an incomplete nature, mainly on
account of the muscular and pericranial attachments in the region
involved.</p>

<p>According to Boullet, the following symptoms <span class="nowrap">result:&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Surgical emphysema and pneumatocele.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Air escapes from
the mastoid cells and antrum into the overlying tissues, either
spreading widely through the subaponeurotic space of the scalp and
cellular tissues of the neck (surgical emphysema), or remaining
localized and forming a tumour of inconsiderable size (pneumatocele).
In either case palpation reveals that peculiar crepitation which is
pathognomonic of tumours of this nature.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Bleeding from the ear.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">H&aelig;morrhage takes place into the
middle ear, and, as the tympanic membrane is usually lacerated, the
blood escapes from the external ear. In the event of the tympanic<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
membrane being uninjured, the blood may escape along the Eustachian
tube into the naso-pharynx.</p>

<p>Boullet also pointed out that certain complications may be
associated with the mastoid lesion. These are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="highline75 allclear">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The displacement of the mastoid process is of
so incomplete a nature that the question of replacement by open
operation seldom arises. In the event, however, of intracranial
complications, operative treatment must be carried out. Under
ordinary circumstances the treatment consists mainly in the prevention
of suppuration. When suppuration occurs, frequent cleansing
of the ear must be carried out in order to prevent accumulation of
pus in middle ear and antrum. This object is to be attained, not
by syringing, but by gentle irrigation and light packing. Later on
it may become necessary to carry out the complete mastoid operation.</p>

<h3>FRACTURES OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL</h3>

<p>Fractures of the vault of the skull may be restricted to the vault
or associated with a basic fracture. Evidence has been brought
forward previously to show that many vault fractures may be regarded
as mere upward extension from a primary basic lesion. The limitation
of a fracture to the vault depends on the nature of the productive
force, the degree of violence used, the site of application, and the
direction of the force. Thus, the smaller the weapon, the greater
the violence, the nearer the site of application to the vertex, the more
direct the blow, the greater is the tendency to vault limitation.
Again, compound fractures are much more liable to vault limitation
than simple fractures, as is proved, for instance, by the reports of
Sir Prescott Hewitt&mdash;20 compound fractures in which the fracture
was restricted to the vault of the skull, and 56 simple fractures
in which the base was involved in all but one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span></p>

<p>Fractures of the vault may <span class="nowrap">involve:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="noindent">(<i>a</i>) the external table only;<br />
(<i>b</i>) the internal table alone;<br />
(<i>c</i>) the whole thickness of the skull.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures of the external table alone.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">These fractures are
excessively rare. Their existence was even doubted till the recent
South African War, when Makins<a id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> saw one case of this nature. They
appear to be due to the impact of a glancing bullet (see <a href="#Page297">p. 297</a>).
A &#8216;gutter-shaped&#8217; depression results, the comminuted fragments of
the external table being carried away or distributed in the region
of the lacerated scalp (see <a href="#Page294">Chapter IX</a>).</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures of the internal table alone.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Ambrose Par&eacute; drew
attention to this class of fracture in 1652, but it remained for Teevan
to investigate more fully the condition in 1865. Previous to Teevan&#8217;s
investigations, it had been considered that the internal table of the
skull was the more brittle, and that fractures confined to the internal
table were to be explained on that hypothesis. Teevan, however,
demonstrated the incorrectness of such a theory, for, on firing bullets
through the skull, from without inwards and from within outwards,
it was found that on all occasions the more distal table suffered the
more severely. This was explained in the following manner:&mdash;the
fracture of the proximal table was produced by the bullet, whilst
that of the distal table resulted, not from the passage of the bullet
alone, but also from various fragments of bone driven along with the
bullet.</p>

<p>Teevan&#8217;s experiments also proved that a fracture of the
internal table alone could be produced mechanically, this being
in obedience to the law that &#8216;when a pressure is applied to a
body the fracture commences on the line of extension, not that of
compression&#8217;.</p>

<p>Fractures of the internal table are undoubtedly more common
in those situations where diploic tissue is prevalent, e.g. in the
frontal, parietal, and upper occipital regions. In the squamo-temporal
and cerebellar regions fractures of the internal table are almost
unknown.</p>

<p>Teevan also stated that &#8216;but little force is required to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
such a fracture, and that they are produced usually by some small
body, such as a stone&#8217;.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures involving the whole thickness of the skull.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fractures which involve the whole thickness of the skull may <span class="nowrap">be:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Simple or compound.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) With or without depression.</p>

<p class="ind108">When depressed, the fragments of bone may be either
loose or interlocked, forming in the latter case the so-called
pond and gutter fractures.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Elevated, usually from sabre-cuts.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Fissured, stellate, comminuted, punctured, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Explosive.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptoms associated with fracture of the vault.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">A diagnosis
of fracture of the vault is <span class="nowrap">made:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>On the evidence obtained by local examination.</p>

<p>On the evidence supplied by symptoms dependent on injury to
the intracranial contents.</p>

<p>The various intracranial lesions are discussed elsewhere (see
<a href="#Page31">Chapters III</a> and <a href="#Page68">IV</a>).</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Evidence supplied by local examination.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">A compound
fracture will be most readily determined by digital examination,
previous to which the scalp-wound must be carefully cleansed.
Digital examination is greatly preferable to investigation with the
aid of the probe. In any case care must be taken to avoid mistaking
one of the sutures of the skull for a fissured fracture.</p>

<p>In simple fractures the diagnosis is frequently obscured by an
extensive subaponeurotic or subpericranial h&aelig;matoma. Irregularities
of surface are more or less diagnostic of a solution in the
surface of the bone, and a linear h&aelig;matoma is of corresponding
clinical value. In any case, the presence of an extensive h&aelig;matoma
must be regarded as of so suggestive a nature that exploration is
called for, more especially when prolonged concussion or compression
are co-existent. Such treatment is imperative when the h&aelig;matoma&mdash;whether
diffuse, localized, or linear&mdash;pulsates, such a condition
implying a breach in the surface of both bone and dura with
communication between the extra-cranial and some intra-cranial
h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span></p>

<p>Pringle<a id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> lays stress on the value of percussion as an aid to
diagnosis.</p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>&#8216;The patient&#8217;s head must be supported beneath the occiput, the
mouth either open or shut&mdash;it matters not, so long as it is the same
throughout the examination&mdash;and the skull is struck sharply with
the finger. When a fracture is present, two changes in note may
be elicited. Either a note lowered in pitch over the fracture zone,
or, in addition, a definite crack-pot sound. The note elicited is
most typical when comminution is present, and some fragments
loose. A fracture of a T or L or V-shape gives the best crack-pot
sound, and the crack quality is always most pronounced when
the percussing finger comes over the angular portion of the bone.
H&aelig;morrhage into the subaponeurotic region blurs the note.&#8217;</p>

<p>Before entering into the question of <i>treatment</i> of fractures of the
skull, it is essential that allusion should be made to the <i>temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
in its relation to head-injuries.</i> The great importance of temperature
changes in the consideration of operative treatment will be manifest
when discussing the treatment of fractures of the base.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The temperature in its relation to head-injuries.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The
various temperature changes observed in cases of head-injury have
afforded a subject prolific in discussion. Broca, Battle, Guyon,
Walsham, and others have endeavoured to deduce facts from the
examination of head cases, but the results have been rather indefinite.
In over 300 cases that have come under my observation,
accurate records of the temperature charts were obtained, the
patients were watched throughout their illness, and in the case of
death, the autopsies were attended.</p>

<p>The following deductions were <span class="nowrap">made:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That, for a variable period of time after the injury, the
temperature is always subnormal&mdash;sometimes so low that it cannot
be registered. This is the period of shock.</p>

<p>2. That the patient may die in this state of shock, but that,
if he lives, reaction takes place and the temperature rises.</p>

<p>3. That this rise in temperature is, in fatal cases, rapid and
progressive. In one case the temperature rose 6&deg; in seven hours,
in another 8&deg; in four hours. Death occurs when the temperature is
at its highest&mdash;anything up to 106&deg;, and even more when registered
in the rectum.</p>

<p>4. That the temperature may rise to a moderate height, and
there &#8216;mark time&#8217;. This is the &#8216;crisis&#8217; of the case. A subsequent
fall in temperature generally indicates recovery, a further rise usually
points to a fatal termination.</p>

<p>5. That the rise of temperature is independent of any special
osseous lesion, since similar changes are observed in fractures of the
vault and in fractures of the base.</p>

<p>6. That laceration of the brain is present in the majority of
cases in which marked temperature changes are observed, but that
the changes in temperature are totally independent of any special
regional brain-injury.</p>

<p>Richet arrives at the conclusion that two hypotheses present
themselves, accounting for temperature changes in general: (1) that
there are certain temperature regulators in the encephalon which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
when excited, become stimulated in function; (2) that the cortical
injury acts in a sort of reflex manner on the regulatory centres
situated in the pons or bulb.</p>

<p>Attention was also drawn to the experiments of Lorin and
van Benedin, who, after excising the two cerebral hemispheres of
a pigeon, showed that the heat regulatory centre was preserved
intact, proving that the corpus striatum is not necessarily the head-office
for heat-regulation in general.</p>

<p>Till, therefore, more evidence comes to hand with respect to
heat-regulation in general, one cannot go beyond the broad statement
that, in severe head-injuries, definite temperature changes occur,
that the changes are independent of any special lesion of bone
or brain, that they are generally associated with some brain-injury,
and that they are probably due to the influence exerted by the
lesion on the heat-regulating centres in the region of the pons
and bulb.</p>

<p>With regard to the value of the temperature, both with respect
to prognosis and treatment, a very much more definite statement
can be made.</p>

<p>First with respect to the <b>prognosis</b>. All cases of head-injury
may be grouped into four classes, according to the changes of temperature
present.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Group 1.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The temperature, at first subnormal, undergoes a rapid
and progressive rise. Prognosis most unfavourable.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Group 2.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The temperature, at first subnormal, rises gradually
to 101&deg; or 102&deg; and there &#8216;marks time&#8217;. This hesitancy marks the
crisis of the case, further elevation indicating a fatal result, whilst
a fall offers every hope of recovery.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Group 3.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The temperature, at first subnormal, rises to normal
and remains at that level. Prognosis very favourable.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Group 4.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The temperature, at first subnormal, remains subnormal.
The condition of shock persists, and the prognosis is
most unfavourable.</p>

<p>Practically all cases of head-injury fall readily into one or other
of these four groups, and the temperature chart presents so clear
a picture that it must be regarded as of the greatest possible value
in estimating the prognosis in any given case. In other words, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
temperature chart affords an almost infallible guide both to prognosis
and treatment.</p>

<p>With respect to alteration in temperature on the two sides of the
body, the clinical value of such changes must, from my own observations,
be regarded as of a very indefinite nature.</p>

<p>It now remains to discuss the value of temperature changes
with respect to treatment.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment of Fracture of the Base of the Skull.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In the
earlier paragraphs of this chapter the special treatment of aural and
nasal h&aelig;morrhages and cerebro-spinal discharge was discussed, and
some allusion was made to the necessity of exploring the middle
fossa in cases of profuse arterial or venous aural bleeding. The
general treatment of basic fractures now requires description, previous
to which, however, space must be made for a short account of the
routine treatment by Urotropin&mdash;as advised by Crowe and Cushing&mdash;as
a prophylactic against the development of meningeal infection.
The following is a summary of Crowe&#8217;s paper<a id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
on the &#8216;excretion of
Urotropin in the cerebro-spinal fluid and its therapeutic value in
meningitis&#8217;.</p>

<p>1. Urotropin, when given by the mouth, invariably appears in
the cerebro-spinal fluid.</p>

<p>2. The largest amount of Urotropin is present in the cerebro-spinal
fluid from thirty minutes to an hour after the ingestion of
the drug.</p>

<p>3. After doses of Urotropin, within therapeutic limits, a sufficient
amount of the drug appears in the cerebro-spinal fluid to exercise
a decided inhibitory effect on the growth of organisms inoculated
into this fluid after its removal from the body.</p>

<p>4. Following a subdural inoculation of dogs and rabbits with
streptococcus, 60-80 grains of Urotropin a day, given under conditions
which insure absorption, will markedly defer, and in some
cases prevent, the onset of a fatal meningitis.</p>

<p>5. In view of these observations, the prompt administration of
Urotropin is advised in all clinical cases in which meningitis is a
possible or threatened complication, or even when meningeal infection
has actually occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span></p>

<p>Acting on these suggestions, I am accustomed to treat all head
cases with this drug, 10-20 grains three times a day by mouth.
It may be given per rectum, though probably with less satisfactory
results. Traumatic cases are treated as soon as possible, other cases
receive their dose for two or three days previous to the operation,
the drug being continued till all fear of possible meningeal infection
has vanished.</p>

<p>In discussing the general treatment of basic fractures, it must
be accepted that the basic fracture in itself requires no treatment.
Danger or death is dependent on intracranial complications, and an
uncomplicated basic fracture demands no active surgical treatment.
The special treatment applicable to cases complicated by h&aelig;morrhages,
both external to and beneath the dura mater, is discussed in the next
chapter. It is therefore only necessary to enter into those cases of
fractured base which are associated with concussion, irritation, and
compression of the brain&mdash;in other words, the <i>average</i> case of fracture
of the base of the skull.</p>

<p>The surgeon must always be guided by the general condition of
the patient&mdash;the blood-pressure, character of pulse, state of respiration,
depth of unconsciousness, &amp;c.&mdash;but, in my opinion, the temperature
chart affords perhaps the most valuable basis on which rules
can be formulated guiding the surgeon in his general line of treatment.</p>

<p>Thus (1) <b>when the temperature remains subnormal</b> the
patient is in a condition of severe cerebral shock, due, in the majority
of cases, to contusion or laceration of the brain, the grosser lesion
being most commonly situated either at the apex of the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe or at the anterior inferior part of the frontal lobe.
The patient is, however, suffering from shock, and the treatment
advocated for that condition in general is equally applicable to these
cases in particular. The patient should be placed in the so-called
head-down position, and the extremities firmly bandaged from below
upwards. The vaso-motor depression should be combated by the
administration of rectal or intra-venous infusions of saline solution,
to each pint of which is added 1 drachm of a 1 in 1,000 solution of
Adrenalin Chloride. It is at once obvious that, whilst combating the
condition of shock, this mode of treatment may tend at the same time
to encourage fresh bleeding if the brain should have been lacerated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
or if intracranial vessels should have been torn. For this reason
I regard rectal infusion as the more safe of the two methods, in spite
of the fact that intra-venous infusion brings about a more rapid
improvement in the patient&#8217;s condition. The effect of the infusion
must be carefully observed, and as soon as the blood-pressure rises
and the temperature shows a tendency to rise&mdash;say from the subnormal
to the normal&mdash;the infusion process must be stopped, and
the further progress of the case observed.</p>

<p>The risks attendant on this mode of treatment are obvious,
but in their consideration, it must also be borne in mind that if the
patient remains in the collapse stage, without evidencing any sign
of reaction, he will inevitably die. If the treatment advocated should
tide the patient over this stage and induce a definite reaction, as
exemplified by rise of blood-pressure and elevation of temperature,
the further treatment of the case can be considered under the next
group.</p>

<p>(2) <b>When the temperature rises progressively</b> the patient
evidences symptoms pointing to compression of the brain&mdash;coma,
slow pulse, noisy and stertorous respiration, hot skin and turgid face.
Later on, as a result of the increasing pressure, the medullary centres
begin to show signs of exhaustion, the pulse-rate increasing, and the
respiration becoming Cheyne-Stokes in character.</p>

<p>Whether these symptoms result primarily from the nature of the
lesion, or secondarily after the adoption of those measures advocated
for the collapse stage, it matters not. Our indications with respect
to treatment are clear. The increasing intracranial pressure must
be reduced. This desideratum is preferably carried out by the ligature
of a bleeding meningeal artery, or by the occlusion of a torn venous
sinus, but unfortunately, such a course is frequently out of the question.
We have, therefore, to deal with an increased and increasing
intracranial pressure, without definite localizing features. For this
condition we have at our disposal the following measures: venesection,
lumbar puncture, and &#8216;decompression&#8217; operations.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Venesection.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">I regard venesection as a valuable means of
reducing the intracranial pressure. It is mainly of use in those cases
that hover between slight compression and the fully-developed
condition. Venesection may therefore be regarded as of special<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
advantage in those cases that show elevation of temperature to about
101&deg; and there &#8216;mark time&#8217;. The &#8216;bleeding&#8217; should be carried out
after exposure of the median basilic, external jugular, or internal
saphenous veins, preferably from the first-named site. The amount
of blood to be withdrawn varies according to the individual circumstances
of the case, but, in general, the escape of blood should be
encouraged till the pulse becomes soft, frequent and compressible.
On an average, the quantity of blood withdrawn varies from 10-20
ounces. The operation not infrequently turns the scale in favour of
the patient. Venesection may also be carried out in combination
with &#8216;decompression&#8217; operations.</p>

<p>When applied to suitable cases and carried out with discrimination,
venesection often tides the patient over the stage of &#8216;crisis&#8217;.
The most careful observation is needed in estimating the quantity
of blood to be withdrawn, the pulse, blood-pressure, respiration, and
temperature affording an adequate guide.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Lumbar puncture.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">In spite of the apparent advantages of this
method, it must, I think, be acknowledged that lumbar puncture
is of but little use in reducing the general intracranial pressure.
Consequently, in spite of the fact that this procedure has been
strongly recommended, experience shows that it is of little practical
use. This statement, based on personal experience, is at variance
with the opinion of some other surgeons. For instance, de Qu&egrave;nu
reports 7 cases of fractured skull which were &#8216;cured&#8217; by this treatment,
one of them requiring to be punctured eight times. Lumbar
puncture assists the diagnosis, but I am doubtful whether it improves
the prognosis.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>&#8216;Decompression&#8217; operations.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">&#8216;Decompression&#8217; operations may
be carried out over the cerebellar fossa or over the temporal region
of the skull. In <b>cerebellar decompression</b> a suitable scalp-flap
is turned down and the trephine applied over the centre of the
exposed occipital bone. After the removal of the disk the wall of
the cerebellar fossa is cut away with the craniectomy forceps, up to
the line of the lateral sinus above, to the mastoid process in front,
to the vicinity of the foramen magnum below, and almost up to the
middle line on the inner side. The bulging dura mater is incised in
a crucial manner, right up to the margins of the osseous gap, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
meningeal vessels that cross the line proposed for dural section being
under-run with a fully-curved needle threaded with catgut. A small
drainage-tube is inserted between the dura and the cerebellum and
brought out through the most dependent part of the scalp-flap. The
flap is then sutured in position. The drainage-tube should be stitched
to the skin and withdrawn twenty-four to forty-eight hours later,
according to the progress of the case.</p>

<p>I have carried out this operation on several occasions, but in
spite of some immediate improvement in the condition of the patient,
the remote results have been so unsatisfactory that I have abandoned
the operation entirely. The effect of this cerebellar decompression
is too radical, the medullary centres strongly object to such heroic
attempts at pressure relief.</p>

<p><i>Temporal</i> decompression, more correctly known as the <b>intermusculo-temporal
decompression</b> operation of Harvey Cushing,
leads to very different results. Previous to dealing with the technique
of the operation, it will be convenient to enumerate the advantages
claimed for this method in general.</p>

<p>(1) The frequency with which the bony lesion occurs in the
middle fossa of the skull.</p>

<p>(2) The fact that cerebral contusions are especially liable to
involve the tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.</p>

<p>(3) The exposure of the meningeal territory and the ease of
determining the presence of an extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>(4) The possibility of draining through a split muscle rather than
directly through the scalp.</p>

<p>(5) The subsequent protective action of the muscle in case
a hernia tends to form in consequence of traumatic &#339;dema.</p>

<p>(6) The subsequent absence of any deformities, the skin incision
being carried out for the most part through the hairy portion of the
scalp.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The operation.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The hair is shaved over the temporal region,
with a wide margin to the field of operation. In other respects, those
preliminary details should be adopted which are enumerated in
<a href="#Page10">Chapter II</a>. The skin incision commences well above and behind
the external angular frontal process, is directed along the line of,
but below the temporal crest, and curves downwards to terminate
just anterior to the tragus of the ear. Pressure is applied during the
formation of the incision so as to control bleeding from temporal
arteries. The flap, comprising skin, subcutaneous tissue, and superficial
temporal artery, is turned down to a zygomatic base, care being
taken to avoid injury to the temporal vessels at the base of the flap.
The temporal fascia is then incised, parallel to but immediately
below the line of the skin incision, and the fascia also turned down
towards the zygoma. The temporal muscle is split in the direction
of its fibres, from the temporal crest above to the zygoma below,
stripped away from the bone and well retracted in both forward and
backward directions. In this procedure care must be taken to avoid
detachment of the muscle-fibres from the temporal crest. The area
of bone exposed, however, should be as extensive as circumstances
permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<p>The trephine is applied to the bone, the surgeon aiming at the
angle between the anterior and posterior branches of the middle
meningeal artery. The disk is removed, the dura separated from the
bone, and the craniectomy forceps called into requisition, the bone
entering into the formation of the temporal fossa being freely cut
away, more especially in the <i>downward</i>, forward, and backward directions&mdash;in
other words, in the general line of the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe. In the upward direction the surgeon must be more guarded,
more especially when the operation is being conducted on the left side
of the head. Broca&#8217;s area of motor speech must be avoided, for fear
of its inclusion in any hernial protrusion that may ensue.</p>

<p>The bulging and probably discoloured dura mater is freely
incised, preferably in a crucial manner, though the exact line of such
incision is of little importance so long as it is free in character. Needless
to say, all meningeal vessels that cross the lines proposed for
dural section must first be ligatured (by underrunning with a fully
curved needle) on either side of those lines. The four dural flaps are
turned aside and the antero-external aspect of the temporo-sphenoidal
pole exposed. A small drainage&mdash;or drain of rubber tissue&mdash;can now
be inserted along the floor of the middle fossa skull in the immediate
vicinity of any lacerated brain or blood-clot, the drain lying between
the dura and the brain, and anchored to the dura mater or muscle
by a fine catgut suture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<p>The four dural flaps are allowed to remain loose over the surface
of the brain, whilst the temporal muscle is sewn across from side to
side with a few catgut sutures, room being allowed at the lower angle
for the emergence of the drain.</p>

<p>The temporal fascia is replaced and carefully united to its upper
cut margin, the drain being brought out through the fascia and
through a puncture hole made at the most convenient part of the
scalp-flap. The scalp-flap is approximated with numerous interrupted
silk or salmon-gut sutures.</p>

<p>The tube is allowed to remain for thirty-six hours or more,
according to the condition of the patient.</p>

<p>The operation may be carried out on one or on both sides of
the skull; if on the one side only, on that side at which laceration
of the brain is probably existent. In connexion with this it is necessary
to state that laceration by contre-coup is more common than
direct brain-injury. Thus, if the blow be inflicted on the right
parieto-occipital region, the operation should be conducted in the
left temporal region.</p>

<p>In the absence of all localizing features the decompression
should be carried out on the <i>right</i> side of the head, in order to avoid
all possibility of including, in the hernial protrusion that may result,
the motor speech area of Broca.</p>

<p>In cases of severe head-injury the surgeon must be prepared for
many disappointments, but, from my own experience, it would appear
that Cushing&#8217;s operation frequently brings about the most satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>It should, however, be clearly understood that indiscriminate
decompression operations only bring discredit on the method in
general. They should only be carried out in suitable cases.</p>

<h3>TREATMENT OF FRACTURES OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Indications for operation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">It is the general custom to
divide fractures of the vault into two groups&mdash;those demanding
operative treatment and those in which an expectant attitude is
advised&mdash;and between these two groups a sharp line of demarcation
is drawn. There is, however, no such line of demarcation. In the
event of the general condition of the patient being compatible with<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
operative interference, such treatment is urgently called for under
the following <span class="nowrap">conditions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>All</i> cases of punctured fracture.</p>

<p><i>All</i> cases of depressed fracture, whether diagnosed by palpation or
by inference, whether simple or compound, whether complicated or not.</p>

<p><i>All</i> cases of fracture complicated by extra-dural or localized subdural
extravasation of blood.</p>

<p><i>All</i> elevated fractures.</p>

<p><i>All</i> compound fractures.</p>

<p>In all these instances, from the presence of depressed fragments
of bone, from associated injury to the intracranial contents, or from
other causes, no mere expectant policy should be pursued. The
surgeon has to look into the future, to bear in mind the possibility
of meningeal infection, and the more remote results of head-injuries
in general (see <a href="#Page182">Chapter VI</a>). In other words, early and active
surgical interference is imperatively demanded, for not only is it
necessary to strain every endeavour to save the patient&#8217;s life, but
the surgeon should also adopt those procedures which guard most
effectually against the more remote possibilities of the case.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>simple</i> fractures, if it can be determined that the
fracture, whether fissured, stellate, or comminuted, is simple and
uncomplicated by any serious intracranial lesion, no active surgical
treatment is required. The determination of such conditions is,
however, quite another matter, always difficult and sometimes, from
the presence of overlying h&aelig;matomata, quite impossible.</p>

<p>In the general estimation of these cases it should be borne in
mind that simple uncomplicated vault fractures are decidedly rare.
For instance, Dwight, in 145 cases of fractured skull that came to
autopsy, only found six that evidenced a fissured fracture localized
to the vault. It may, of course, be urged that these statistics are
fallacious, insomuch as simple uncomplicated vault fractures would
probably not come to the post-mortem table. Clinical evidence,
however, coincides with Dwight&#8217;s statistics, and clinical evidence
shows, furthermore, that a blow sufficing to fracture the vault of the
skull almost invariably results in further injury.</p>

<p>In these doubtful cases the surgeon is greatly aided in his decision
by a general review of the patient&#8217;s condition, more especially by<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
those symptoms which are regarded as exemplifying the clinical
conditions of concussion, irritation, and compression.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with mild concussion</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">it may be
inferred that the brain is practically uninjured, and that operative
treatment is not required.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with severe concussion</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">it may be
inferred that the brain is damaged, to a degree proportionate to the
depth and duration of the stage of unconsciousness. The question
of operation depends to a very large extent on the general condition
of the patient, and more especially on the temperature and temperature
changes (see <a href="#Page114">p. 114</a>). With a persistent subnormal temperature
it may be inferred that the brain-injury is of a very severe nature, and
that operative measures are, for the time being, contra-indicated.
In the event of the temperature rising it may be accepted that the
patient is passing from the state of shock to that of reaction, operative
measures again hinging on the further progress of the case. If the
temperature rises progressively, the patient passing from the stage
of reaction to that of compression, operative measures are indicated.
Under other circumstances an expectant attitude can be adopted.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with general cerebral irritation</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">it may be inferred that the brain is contused or slightly lacerated.
Under these circumstances operation is, for the time being, not
required, and an expectant attitude should be adopted.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with compression</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">it may be inferred
that the condition is dependent on depressed fragments of bone,
or on extra- or intra-dural bleeding. Operative measures are now
urgently indicated.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is confined to the internal table</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">a diagnosis is
only possible when symptoms of localized irritation ensue, either due
to pressure exercised on the cortex by spicules of bone or resulting
from injury to some intracranial vessel, e. g. the middle meningeal
artery. In such cases operation is indicated. Under other circumstances
the surgeon must await the developments of the case.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline following"><i>When the fracture is associated with mild concussion.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">During the stage of concussion no active treatment is required, beyond
putting the patient to bed&mdash;with the head low&mdash;enveloping him in hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
blankets, and applying hot bottles to the extremities. These bottles
are wrapped up in flannel: they should never be placed in contact
with the patient&#8217;s skin. As soon as the reaction stage <i>commences</i>,
the bottles and blankets should be removed, the patient covered
with light clothing only, and an ice-bag applied to the head, over
the region at which the injury was inflicted. Calomel, in suitable
doses, should be given by mouth, and a copious enema administered
per rectum. Perhaps the most essential point in the general consideration
of the case is the after-treatment. The patient should be
kept in hospital or home for at least one month, and for the next
three months or more, according to the urgency of the case, he should
abstain from all mental and bodily work. At the end of that period
of time he may return to work, though still kept under observation.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with severe concussion.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">In the
event of persistence of concussion symptoms of a severe type the
prognosis is decidedly unfavourable. This prolongation of cerebral
shock is undoubtedly dependent in its persistence on severe vaso-motor
depression, and in the majority of cases ending unfavourably
it will be found that the brain is generally &#339;dematous and regionally
contused or lacerated. In cases of this nature the surgeon should
confine his attention, for the time being, to an endeavour at terminating
this vaso-motor depression, raising the blood-pressure and inducing
a definite reaction; the patient being treated after the manner
indicated on <a href="#Page118">p. 118</a>.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>When the fracture is associated with general cerebral irritation.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The patient should be put to bed in a quiet and darkened room, under
the continuous attention of a trained nurse. An ice-bag or Leiter&#8217;s
tubes may be applied to the head, though the patient seldom tolerates
such attentions. I regard morphia as of the greatest service in this
class of cases. It should be given freely, subcutaneously, either by itself
or in combination with atropin. I generally order <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> gr. morphia with
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> gr. atropin every six hours, till the irritative symptoms subside.</p>

<p>Insomuch as all evidence tends to prove that general cerebral
irritation, as resulting from injury, implies a condition of contusion
or superficial laceration, a prolonged period of bodily and mental rest
is essential before the patient is discharged from treatment and
allowed to return to work&mdash;a period of not less than six months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The operative treatment of fractures of the vault.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The usual preparatory treatment is carried out, the scalp-tourniquet
applied, a suitable scalp-flap framed and turned down, advantage
being taken of all existent scalp lacerations.</p>

<p>The subsequent details vary according to the circumstances of
the <span class="nowrap">case:&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fissured fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">If, after thorough exposure of the
parts, the operator is satisfied that he has to deal with an uncomplicated
fissured fracture, the scalp-flap is accurately sewn
into position (see <a href="#Page16">p. 16</a>). On the other hand, if the symptoms
point to the presence of an extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage, the bone is
trephined where the fracture crosses the line of the suspected vessel
and the conditions treated as described under middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage. In subdural extravasation the trephine is applied over
that part of the brain, in the immediate vicinity of the fracture,
from which the symptoms appear to emanate, and the conditions
treated as described under subdural h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>In a certain proportion of cases the symptoms point to a marked
increase of intracranial pressure without definite localizing features,
a condition pointing to diffuse subdural h&aelig;morrhage, with or without
brain laceration. Under such circumstances much may be done to
relieve the increased intracranial pressure by carrying out the operation
of &#8216;cerebral decompression&#8217; (see <a href="#Page121">p. 121</a>).</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Depressed fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The operative details vary according to
the nature of the osseous <span class="nowrap">lesion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If the depressed fragments of bone are so interlocked that
elevation is impossible (e. g. pond and gutter fractures), it will be
necessary to trephine in the immediate vicinity of the depression, in
order to lessen the mutual attachment of the fragments one to another,
so obtaining sufficient purchase for their elevation or removal.</p>

<p>The pericranium is stripped away from the region of the depression
(see <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>), and a small trephine applied in such a manner
that the trephine circle includes the outer part of the depressed area.
Care must be taken to avoid more pressure over the depressed
fragments than is absolutely necessary, for fear of causing further
damage to the underlying structures. This advice is all the more
important when it is realized that the fracture of the internal table<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
is almost invariably more extensive than that which involves the
visible external table of the skull.</p>

<p>The disk of bone is removed and the conditions investigated with
the dural separator. When the degree of depression and the splintering
of the internal table are not excessive, the parts may be elevated
into position. In most cases, however, the uncertainty that exists
with regard to possible dural injury renders it necessary that the
depressed fragments should be elevated and removed, or so raised
as to allow of adequate inspection of the dura itself. For this purpose
the craniectomy forceps may be required. The dura can now be
examined. If torn, the opening may require enlargement, in order
to determine whether any osseous fragments have been driven into
the brain-substance; all such fragments are carefully removed.
H&aelig;morrhage is arrested, the dura sewn up, and the scalp-flap
carefully sutured. Drainage should always be avoided, the risk of
infection is too great. As a prophylactic against the development
of meningeal infection, the patient should undergo the routine treatment
with urotropin (see <a href="#Page116">p. 116</a>).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the depression is of such a nature that the elevation of
the fragments can be carried out without preliminary trephining, the
fragments are raised with the periosteal separator, and the membranes
and brain examined as described above.</p>

<p>In <b>simple comminuted fractures</b> the larger fragments of
bone are to be replaced in the anticipation that they will live entire,
in part, or will act as scaffolding media for the formation of dense
fibrous tissue. After removal from the wound, and during the completion
of the operation, the vitality of all loose fragments may be
preserved by immersion in hot saline solution. All minute fragments
of bone should be discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49b. The Elevation of a Depressed Fracture.</span> <i>Second stage.</i>
The trephine disk has been removed and the elevator is in position.</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to <b>compound</b> fractures, it is necessary that the
bone lesion should be fully exposed, all pockets of scalp-tissue being
slit up to their termination. Previous to any attempt at examination
of the injured bone, further precautions must be taken to avoid
subsequent infection, by reason of the bruised and soiled scalp. Such
tags of scalp-tissue as appear injured beyond repair should be cut
away with the scissors, and in order to avoid or diminish subsequent
wound infection, I have been accustomed to swab over the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
suspicious parts with pure carbolic acid, washing away the same with
saline solution. Since the advent of iodine sterilization, I have often
utilized that solution in preference to the carbolic, swabbing the whole
surface exposed. I think a combination of the two methods is advisable
in more serious cases, utilizing the carbolic for the margins of the
wound and iodine for the general surface. By means of this method
the risk of meningeal infection and scalp suppuration is greatly
reduced. To aid in the prophylaxis, the patient should again be
placed under a course of treatment by urotropin (see <a href="#Page116">p. 116</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to the bone, all loose fragments should be removed,
only those being preserved which retain their pericranial connexions.
Even these are thrown back so as to permit of the maximum inspection
of the dura mater. This membrane, if torn, is either sewn up
at once or opened up more freely in the investigation and removal
of underlying blood-clot or bone-d&eacute;bris. After removing such troubles
the membrane is accurately sutured. The bone-flaps are now replaced
in position. Some surgeons advocate the replacement of the smaller
fragments of bone which have previously been removed. These
fragments may be sterilized by boiling, but such a process destroys
the bone-cells and, in consequence, they become absorbed, merely
acting as scaffolding media for the formation of fibrous tissue. Added
to that, in the event of suppuration, the presence of such fragments
not only leads to the persistence of a purulent discharge, till the fragments
are entirely removed, but also increases considerably the risk
of meningeal infection.</p>

<p>As a summary, therefore, it may be laid down that it is necessary
to remove all loose fragments of bone, the deficiency in the vault
being rectified, if necessary, at a later date by one of the methods
enumerated in <a href="#Page182">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p>The scalp-flap is accurately sewn up with interrupted salmon-gut
sutures, a gauze or cigarette drain being inserted at the most convenient
and dependent point, to be removed at the end of forty-eight
hours or more according to the progress of the case.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Punctured fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Here there is a special liability to
dural laceration and in-driving of comminuted fragments of bone.
A full exposure of the parts is therefore absolutely essential. The
trephine can be applied in the immediate vicinity of the puncture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
or, as is often advisable, in such a manner that the punctured area
is included in the trephine circle: this latter method may necessitate
that the trephining should be carried out without the aid of the
guiding fixation-pin, for which process some experience is needed.</p>

<p>After removal of the bone, the craniectomy forceps may be
required, to allow of adequate dural inspection. The dura mater is
opened up with blunt-pointed scissors, and the brain examined for
in-driven fragments of bone. These, when found, are removed.
Deeply situated fragments of bone and foreign bodies may be previously
diagnosed by means of an X-ray picture.</p>

<p>If possible, both membrane and scalp should be sutured without
drainage, but in the event of possible sepsis, a small cigarette drainage-tube
should be inserted so as to lie beneath the dura mater on the
one hand and emerge through the scalp wound at the other.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures limited to the external table.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">For this class of
fracture the reader is referred to the section dealing with bullet-wounds
of the skull (see <a href="#Page296">p. 296</a>).</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures limited to the internal table.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">As previously
indicated, the diagnosis of this condition is only practicable when the
depression of the osseous fragments, or the h&aelig;morrhage resulting
from an injured meningeal vessel, so irritate the dura mater and brain
that localizing symptoms ensue. For instance, epileptic fits of a
Jacksonian type may develop shortly after the accident, this condition
demanding a full exposure of the affected region. The operations
required in the treatment of traumatic epilepsy and intracranial
h&aelig;morrhages are discussed in subsequent chapters.</p>

<h3>THE MORTALITY FROM FRACTURE OF THE SKULL</h3>

<p>Whatever the nature of the osseous lesion, the mortality is almost
entirely dependent on the question of associated injury to the intracranial
contents, more especially the brain.</p>

<p>In the case of fractures purely or mainly basic, of the cases that
have come under my care or observation, 116 recovered and 89 died&mdash;a
mortality of 44 per cent.</p>

<p>Battle, from an examination of 168 cases, puts the mortality at
the low figure of 32 per cent., whilst Crandon and Wilson, from an
exhaustive series of 530 cases, estimates it at 44 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span></p>

<p>The mortality varies according to the <i>age</i> of the patient, the
death-rate being at its maximum at the two extremes of life&mdash;between
50 and 60 per cent. under the age of 5 years and over 60 per cent.
after the age of 70.</p>

<p>The mortality varies also according to the <i>fossa</i> implicated. Thus,
to each fossa there are certain peculiar dangers&mdash;to the <i>anterior</i>
fossa, meningeal infection from the nose, frontal and ethmoidal
sinuses; to the <i>middle</i> fossa, meningeal infection from the naso-pharynx
and ear, and h&aelig;morrhage from the middle meningeal and
internal carotid arteries, and from the cavernous venous sinus; and to
the <i>posterior</i> fossa, laceration of the lateral and sigmoid venous sinuses.</p>

<p>After such consideration of local complications, it would appear
that the middle fossa of the skull presents the greatest dangers.
Another factor must, however, be taken into consideration&mdash;injury
to the brain&mdash;the commonest cause of death in all head injuries.
The main vital centres are grouped in the region of the fourth ventricle,
and Leonard Hill has proved that any increase in the intracranial
pressure exerts its influence most rapidly and most effectually
when the lesion is situated beneath the tentorium cerebelli.</p>

<p>One may assume, therefore, that fractures of the posterior fossa
are the most dangerous, and that those involving the anterior fossa
hold out the best prognosis.</p>

<p>In the case of pure or primary vault fractures the mortality
may be estimated by reference to the following table. It is composed
from 88 cases admitted into St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital between the
years 1900 and 1906.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="chapname">INTRACRANIAL INJURIES: EXTRA- AND SUB-DURAL H&AElig;MORRHAGES.
INJURY TO THE BRAIN</span></h2>

<h3>H&AElig;MORRHAGES</h3>

<h4><b>I. Extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage.</b></h4>

<p>Extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage may be arterial or venous in origin.
In the former case the blood is derived almost exclusively from the
middle meningeal artery. When of venous origin the source is usually
to be found in a laceration of one of the sinuses of the brain. When
blood is poured out from a torn sinus it tends to occupy, and be widely
diffused in, the subdural space. A venous extra-dural extravasation
is relatively of infrequent occurrence, and the pressure exercised on
the brain seldom suffices to permit of the development of local or
general symptoms of cerebral compression. On these grounds extra-dural
h&aelig;morrhage may be regarded as almost necessarily of arterial
origin, and as derived from a torn middle meningeal artery.</p>

<h5><b>Middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage.</b></h5>

<h6 class="inline"><i>General considerations.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The middle meningeal artery enters the
middle fossa of the skull through the foramen spinosum, and divides,
after a short intracranial course, into two main terminal divisions,
anterior and posterior. The <i>anterior</i> branch passes forwards towards
the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, then changing direction
and turning upwards and backwards towards the vertex of the skull.
The <i>posterior</i> branch passes horizontally backwards&mdash;grooving the
squamous portion of the temporal bone&mdash;towards the posterior
inferior angle of the parietal bone.</p>

<p>Throughout their intracranial course the main trunk and its
terminal branches are embedded in the outer wall of the dura mater,
except in the spheno-parietal region, where the anterior branch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
artery usually occupies a channel in the bone&mdash;one between <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> and
1 inch in extent.</p>

<p>The anterior branch overlies the pre-Rolandic motor area, whilst
the posterior division is related to the temporo-sphenoidal and lower
parietal regions&mdash;&#8216;silent&#8217; areas of the brain.</p>

<p>Middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage occurs most commonly in connexion
with a fissured or comminuted fracture of the temporal
region&mdash;the result of direct violence. A fracture, however, is not
necessarily present, the h&aelig;morrhage may take place on the side
opposite to that at which the injury was received (laceration by contre-coup),
and both vessels may be involved. Crisp English narrates
three cases in which bilateral extravasation resulted. These more
rare examples of middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage are more or less
confined to patients suffering from marked arterial degeneration.</p>

<p>Middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage, uncomplicated by brain injury,
is of infrequent occurrence, the associated injuries to bone and brain
confusing the diagnosis. Moreover, the special pressure effects are
dependent not only on the absence of serious brain lesion, but also
on the non-existence of a safety-valve, such, for instance, as is
afforded by a comminuted fracture of the bones entering into the
formation of the temporal fossa, or of the roof of the middle and
external ears. In the former case, blood will force its way into the
temporal region, there forming a temporal h&aelig;matoma&mdash;one that may
pulsate&mdash;whilst, in the latter case, the blood escapes freely from the
external auditory meatus. It should be noted, however, that pressure
applied to the temporal h&aelig;matoma may lead to the development
of irritative or paralytic symptoms confined to the muscles of the
opposite side of the body, whilst the restriction of aural bleeding, by
means of plugs inserted into the ear, will lead to the early development
of compression symptoms.</p>

<p>The amount of blood extravasated varies&mdash;according to the
calibre of the vessel involved&mdash;from a drachm to several ounces.
The largest coagulum that has come under my observation was
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in the long diameter and 1 inch in thickness. Kr&ouml;nlein
narrates a case in which the clot weighed 9 ounces.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>In shape the clot is elliptical; in consistency it is either fluid or
jelly-like. During the early stages of its formation it can be readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[
138]</span>
removed. Later on, it adheres to the dura mater, and, when removed,
leaves that membrane rough and discoloured.</p>

<p>Some uncertainty exists as to the relative frequency with which
the trunk and the two terminal branches are exposed to injury. There
can be no doubt that the majority of cases in which typical clinical
symptoms are present are such as evidence injury to the anterior
terminal division; this is due to the anatomical relation of the clot
to the motor cortex. Injury to the main trunk is of the rarest occurrence,
for the foramen spinosum lies immediately anterior to the
petro-sphenoidal suture, the course pursued by typical middle fossa
fractures. I have seen one case only, and have read the accounts of
two others, in which the foramen spinosum was directly implicated.</p>

<p>The attachment of the dura mater to the sides and base of the
skull exercises a most important influence on the direction in which
the blood spreads. Firmly adherent to the lesser wing of the sphenoid
in front and to the summit of the petrous bone behind, the membrane
intervening between these two regions is but loosely attached to, and
readily stripped away from, the floor of the middle fossa. As the clot
increases in size it exerts considerable mechanical pressure and tends
to separate still further the dura from the bone. The anterior and
posterior limitations compel the blood to extend first in the outward
direction and then upwards towards the vertex of the skull.</p>

<p>Kr&ouml;nlein divides middle meningeal extravasations, according to
their regional distribution, into three main <span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Temporo-parietal (the most common variety).</p>

<p>Parieto-occipital (rare).</p>

<p>Parieto-frontal (very rare).</p>

<p>Middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhages yielding typical clinical symptoms
are of infrequent occurrence, yet such extravasations are very
commonly present in severe lesions of the skull. This is evidenced
by the fact that middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;of a greater or lesser
degree&mdash;was found in 20 per cent. of all cases of fractured skull, and
in 45 per cent. of those in which the middle fossa was involved. My
experience is confirmed by Dwight and Nichols. For example,
Dwight, in 149 autopsies, notes that middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage
was existent in 49 cases (29 per cent.). He maintains further that the
artery is injured in nearly every case in which the fracture, extending<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
from vault to base or vice versa, involves the middle fossa of the
skull. Nichols reports 11 cases in 32 autopsies (34 per cent.).</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">As the direct result of the blow the patient
is &#8216;concussed&#8217;, remaining in that condition for a variable period
of time, a matter of seconds, minutes, or hours, according to the nature
of the associated damage to the bone and brain. In the most typical
cases, the patient, on regaining consciousness, should recover&mdash;again
for a variable period of time&mdash;complete control over mind and body,
returning to work, walking home or visiting hospital or doctor.
More usually, however, he remains slightly dazed, though recognizing
his surroundings and capable of answering questions. In any case&mdash;unless
the h&aelig;morrhage is accompanied by grave cerebral lesion&mdash;there
should be some attempt at recovery, some return to consciousness.
The importance of this &#8216;lucid interval&#8217; cannot be over-estimated.
It should be noted, however, that this interval of consciousness
is not of itself absolutely diagnostic of middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;it ought to be associated with definite localizing
symptoms of brain compression (see below). I have encountered
several cases in which this lucid interval was present, and in which
operative procedures were carried out in the anticipation of finding
an extra-dural extravasation, only to find a subdural h&aelig;morrhage.
Such subdural h&aelig;morrhages are not infrequently associated with
a similar return to the conscious state, but are rarely&mdash;if ever&mdash;accompanied
by the early development of symptoms of localized
brain compression. In the event of doubt as to whether the surgeon
has to deal with an extra or subdural extravasation lumbar puncture
will probably clear up the diagnosis.</p>

<p>The duration of this &#8216;lucid&#8217; interval is exceedingly variable.
It is usually a matter of minutes or hours, though both K&ouml;nig and
Wiesman narrate cases in which eight days elapsed before the onset
of definite localized compression symptoms. I also have recollections
of a case in which the patient walked some miles across the moor
to see his doctor, and finding him away from home, walked home
again, then becoming unconscious and dying shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>All depends on the calibre of the vessel injured and on the
existence of a safety-valve, by means of which some of the extravasated
blood can escape externally (see <a href="#Page97">p. 97</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span></p>

<p>No rule can be laid down as to the duration of this &#8216;lucid&#8217;
interval, but all authorities are agreed as to its existence, even though
it may be of exceeding short duration. Its importance, from a clinical
point of view, cannot be overestimated. It was present in 43 out of 63
cases reported by Jacobson, well marked in 32 (50 per cent.), less
marked in 11 (18 per cent.). It was observed in 60 per cent. of cases
that came under my care.</p>

<p>During this period the blood is occupied in stripping away the
dura from the bone&mdash;the larger the vessel the easier the task and the
shorter the &#8216;lucid&#8217; interval.</p>

<p>The further progress of the case may be considered according to
the <i>general and local effects</i> of the h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>General effects.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">As soon as the clot becomes of sufficient size
as to exert general pressure on the brain, symptoms of compression
become evident, the patient first entering on the stage of &#8216;slow
cerebration&#8217;. He is dull and apathetic, showing marked delay in
responding to questions. As the pressure increases, he gradually
passes into a state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The pulse becomes full and slow, the blood-pressure rises progressively
(to 200 or more mms. of Hg.), respiration is laboured and
stertorous, and the temperature raised (rising progressively). The
skin is hot, the face turgid and cyanosed. If the pressure is unrelieved,
stimulation of the medullary centres gives place to exhaustion, the
pulse becoming irregular and rapid, blood-pressure falls rapidly, and
respiration is of irregular rhythm and finally Cheyne-Stokes in
character. Finally, the patient becomes completely comatose, the
pupils are widely dilated, and the cornea insensitive. Both urine
and f&aelig;ces may be passed (through paralysis of the sphincters),
the extremities exhibit flaccid paralysis and the reflexes are
abolished. Death occurs primarily through paralysis of the respiratory
centre.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Local effects.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">In many cases considerable help to diagnosis
may be obtained by external examination&mdash;bruising and ecchymosis,
or definite h&aelig;matomata, in the temporal or parietal regions. In some
cases the h&aelig;matoma may pulsate, and in others the application of
pressure to the h&aelig;matoma will lead to the development of fits involving
the face and extremities on the contra-lateral side. Copious<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
h&aelig;morrhage from the ear should always arouse suspicion as to the
probability of an extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage (see <a href="#Page97">p. 97</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>anterior</i> branch of the artery, as it passes upwards towards
the vertex, overlies the pre-Rolandic or motor area. The pressure
exercised on that region of the brain leads&mdash;according to the site
of extravasation and the degree of pressure exercised&mdash;to the development
of twitchings, convulsions, spasticity, or paralysis of the muscles
of the face, upper and lower extremities on the contra-lateral side of
the body.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51. To illustrate Compression of the Brain.</span> As produced by an
extra-dural h&aelig;morrhage from the posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The late Professor von Bergmann<a id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> pointed out that the arm area
is most commonly affected, and that the leg area is never alone
implicated. Wiesmann<a id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
states &#8216;that isolated paralysis of the leg area<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
is never seen, but only paresis when the arm is paralysed, or both may
be similarly affected at once; convulsions may precede the affection&#8217;.</p>

<p>In discussing the frequency of local compression effects, Wiesmann
points out that some abnormal condition of the opposite extremities
was only absent in 16 out of a total of 257 cases. In 37 cases reported
by Jacobson,<a id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> hemiplegia, of a greater or lesser extent, was present
in 19 (50 per cent.). The same authority explains that &#8216;with regard
to the onset of convulsions, if there be restlessness, spasmodic twitchings,
or movements of the limbs, it is only too probable that in addition
to middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage, contusion or laceration of the brain-substance
will be found at more places than one&#8217;.</p>

<p>In cases that have come under my observation twitchings of the
muscles of the face and upper extremities were observed in 37 per cent.
of cases, and paralysis in the same number. Some alteration in the
condition of the muscles on the contra-lateral side was present
therefore in 74 per cent. of cases.</p>

<p>If the h&aelig;morrhage be situated on the left side of the brain, both
motor and sensory cortical speech areas may be involved, especially
the former.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>reflexes</i>, it has previously been stated that the
reflexes are abolished. This is true with respect to the later stages of
fully-developed compression. In the earlier state the reflexes on the
contra-lateral side may be increased, the difference between the two
sides affording some help in the differential diagnosis.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Pupillary changes</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">are variable. According to Jonathan
Hutchinson, the pupil on the affected side becomes dilated, the blood
extending inwards towards the cavernous sinus and exercising direct
compression of the third nerve. The frequency with which a dilated
pupil occurs in cases of middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage, and the
causation thereof, are, however, matters of dispute. Phelps writes
as follows: &#8216;Reference to cases cited show that the so-called Hutchinson
pupil may be observed as well in h&aelig;morrhages occurring in other
situations than the middle fossa, and in some cases of cerebral lesion
without injury at all. There is no reason to doubt that it is the result
of cerebral contusion, but in what relation they stand to specific
cerebral injuries is undetermined.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span></p>

<p>Walton states that &#8216;doubtless various factors play an important
part in producing the dilated pupil, but if disorders of any simple
mechanism are to be credited with the production of the Hutchinson
pupil or other pupillary changes, the only lesion worthy of the place
is disturbance, irritative or paralytic, of the intracranial fibres of the
cilio-spinal tract&#8217;.</p>

<p>The late Professor von Bergmann, from 70 cases, reports as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>In 39 cases both pupils were markedly dilated (56 per cent.).</p>

<p>In 7 cases both pupils were markedly contracted (10 per cent.).</p>

<p>In 20 cases the pupil on the same side was dilated (30 per cent.).</p>

<p>In 4 cases the pupil on the opposite side was dilated (6 per cent.).</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>Parsons, in answering some queries in 1903, <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>&#8216;I should anticipate from cortical irritation bilateral pupillary
dilatation, perhaps more marked on the opposite side: from pressure
the opposite effects, so far as mere cortical paralysis goes, but this
would be more liable to be vitiated by vascular changes&mdash;the complex
condition seen in coma. It is very difficult to elicit pupillary constriction
by cortical stimuli&mdash;very easy to elicit dilatation, but always
bilateral though often more marked on the opposite side.&#8217;</p>

<p>In cases examined by me the following conditions were <span class="nowrap">found:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From my experience, therefore, and from that of the authorities
quoted above, it would appear that alterations in the size of the pupil
are of very doubtful significance in the diagnosis of middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage, and that the &#8216;Hutchinson pupil&#8217; is but rarely observed.</p>

<p>The results obtained by ophthalmoscopic examination are of much
greater value. Such investigations should be carried out as a routine
procedure. In the earlier stages of the h&aelig;morrhage some &#339;dema of
the disk, together with dilatation of retinal veins and diminution
in the calibre of the arteries, will be observed on the affected side.
This affords a most valuable aid in the differential diagnosis as to the
side on which the h&aelig;morrhage is situated&mdash;not always such a simple
matter as appears at first sight.</p>

<h6 class="inline following"><i>For H&aelig;morrhage from the anterior branch.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">After
the usual preparatory treatment, the &#8216;site of election&#8217; for trephining
is marked out on the scalp by taking a point which lies 2 inches
posterior to the external angular frontal process, and the same
distance above the zygoma. A bradawl may be introduced so as to
indent the external table of the skull, thus aiding the subsequent
accurate application of the trephine.</p>

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52b. Exposure of the Branches of the Middle Meningeal Artery.</span>
<i>Second stage.</i> The trephine-holes have been enlarged with the craniectomy forceps
in the required directions.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The incision commences immediately posterior to the external
angular frontal process, curves upwards and backwards along the
temporal crest, and terminates in front of the tragus of the ear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
The flap, comprising skin, temporal fascia and muscle, and pericranium,
is turned to its zygomatic base and all bleeding-points secured.</p>

<p>The subsequent procedures vary according to the condition of
the <span class="nowrap">bone:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>If there be no fracture of the bone</i>, the pin of the trephine is applied
to the indented spot and the disk of bone removed. After the removal
of the disk the clot will be exposed; but, in order to obtain full
exposure, the gap must be enlarged with the craniectomy forceps,
mainly in the upward and downward directions.</p>

<p><i>If a fissured fracture be found</i>, the trephine is applied in close
relation to the intersection of the line of the artery and the line of the
fracture, the gap being enlarged in the required direction.</p>

<p><i>When the fracture is comminuted</i>, the fragments of bone are either
elevated or removed until sufficient room has been obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span></p>

<p>The greater part of the clot can be removed with a Volkmann
spoon, or with an ordinary teaspoon, and the region flushed out
with hot saline solution.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>To secure the bleeding-points.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">When the artery is injured beyond
the limits of the gap, the bone must be nibbled away till the bleeding-point
is exposed. In some cases it may be necessary to remove
a considerable portion of the bone entering into the formation of
the temporal fossa. In the meantime, h&aelig;morrhage may be controlled
by plugging towards the base of the skull with strips of gauze.
Sufficient room having been obtained, the gauze is withdrawn, when
smart sponging should enable the operator to determine the source
of the h&aelig;morrhage. At this stage of the operation, a head-lamp is
useful. After the exposure of the bleeding-points, the following
measures can be adopted whereby to arrest the <span class="nowrap">bleeding:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The application of a ligature or of silver &#8216;clips&#8217; (see <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>)
on either side of the bleeding-point.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The vessel may be underrun on either side of the bleeding-point.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The vessel may be seized with artery forceps and twisted.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The h&aelig;morrhage may be arrested by means of gauze
plugs.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The foramen spinosum may be occluded with bone or wooden
pegs.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The common or external carotid arteries may be ligatured.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to control the h&aelig;morrhage by means
of ligature, silver clip, underrunning, or torsion. Gauze plugs may
usually be relied on to stop the bleeding, but they possess the great
disadvantage of exercising pressure on the cortex and preventing
expansion of the brain.</p>

<p>Occlusion of the foramen spinosum and ligature of the carotid
arteries complicate and prolong the operation. The foramen spinosum
is occluded in the following manner: the dura mater is quickly
stripped up with the fingers away from the base of the skull, the soft
parts gently but firmly retracted and the foramen identified. Its
occlusion may be effected by means of a sterilized wooden match
or bone peg, by a small piece of bone derived from those osseous
fragments which have been removed during the operation, or with<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
the aid of a piece of catgut; in each case the occluding medium should
be well driven into the foramen.</p>

<p>It is open to doubt whether ligature of the carotid arteries is ever
necessary, though several cases have been recorded in which such
a procedure was carried out. The external carotid should be tied
in preference to the common vessel, further interference with the
blood-supply of the brain increasing necessarily the risk of cerebral
&#339;dema, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The h&aelig;morrhage having been arrested by one or other of these
methods, the cavity is thoroughly washed out with hot saline solution
and drained, a small rubber drainage-tube being brought out through
the scalp-flap. The tube should be removed after twenty-four to
thirty-six hours, according to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>For h&aelig;morrhage from the posterior branch.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The &#8216;site of election&#8217;
for exposure of the posterior branch lies at the intersection of the two
following <span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A line drawn backwards from the upper border of the orbit
parallel to Reid&#8217;s base-line.</p>

<p>A line drawn vertically upwards from the posterior border of the
mastoid process.</p>

<p>The trephine is applied, the disk removed, and the gap enlarged
with the craniectomy forceps in the forward and backward directions.
The h&aelig;matoma is evacuated and the bleeding arrested after the
methods enumerated above.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Results.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The ultimate result of operation for middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage depends on two factors&mdash;the time at which operation is
carried out, and the question of brain lesion. There is every reason
to believe that, when treated early and when uncomplicated by
brain injury, the prognosis, both immediate and remote, is wholly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Wiesman<a id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> collected 257 cases, of which 110 were submitted to
operation, with a mortality of 27 per cent. Of the cases in which
no operation was performed 88 per cent. died.</p>

<p>Duchaine<a id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> reports 27 cases in which operation was carried out,

<p>Blake only lost 3 cases out of a total of 42 submitted to operation.</p>

<p>Even when every allowance is made for the fact that operative
measures were adopted in the more hopeful cases, the above statistics

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Before passing on to <b>subdural h&aelig;morrhage</b>, it will be convenient
to discuss briefly the question of injury to the <b>internal
carotid artery</b>.</p>

<p>This vessel, during its forward passage in the outer wall of the
cavernous sinus, from the posterior to the anterior clinoid processes,
crosses the line of the typical middle fossa fracture (see <a href="#Page84">p. 84</a>). The
artery is loosely embedded in the sinus, it is protected by the third,
fourth, ophthalmic division of the fifth and sixth nerves, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
situated some distance above the level of the base of the skull. In
spite of this degree of protection from injury, the artery may be
lacerated in this part of its intracranial passage. The basic fracture
is necessarily of a very severe nature. Two cases have come under
my own care: one in which both arteries were torn across, the fracture
passing from one middle fossa to the other, with such wide separation
of the anterior and posterior segments of the skull that the two were
freely movable on one another (<a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a>), whilst in the second case,
the fracture, originating in the left frontal region, passed backwards
across the anterior fossa, comminuting the base in the region of the
cavernous sinus, lacerating that sinus and tearing the artery (<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span></p>

<p>In some few cases the vascular lesion is confined to a minute
tear in the coats of the vessel, a fistulous communication being
formed between the artery and the cavernous sinus&mdash;arterio-venous
aneurysm. This condition is discussed on <a href="#Page204">p. 204</a>.</p>

<h4><b>II. Subdural h&aelig;morrhage.</b></h4>

<p>H&aelig;morrhage into the subdural space may be (<i>a</i>) diffuse, or
(<i>b</i>) localized.</p>

<h5 class="inline">(<i>A</i>) <b>Diffuse subdural h&aelig;morrhage.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The blood may be
derived from one of the great sinuses of the brain or from superficial
cerebral vessels (laceration of the brain).</p>

<p>The <i>superior longitudinal sinus</i> may be torn by the in-driving of
fragments of bone in a comminuted depressed fracture of the vertex,
or by wide separation along the line of the sagittal suture. Blood is
diffused throughout the subdural space, on one or on both sides of
the falx cerebri, but always tending to gravitate towards the lower
limits of the supra-tentorial space.</p>

<p>In the event of the wound being compound, air may enter into
the sinus. Insomuch, however, as the sinus pressure is, under normal
conditions, positive, this complication is of rare occurrence, unless
the patient is in a state of profound shock, from loss of blood, or
suffers from urgent dyspn&#339;a.</p>

<p>Allusion should also be made to the condition described by
Stromeyer, as &#8216;sinus pericranii&#8217;, where a subpericranial h&aelig;matoma
communicates with a venous sinus. Such h&aelig;matomata may pulsate,
are more or less reducible on pressure, and are increased on straining
or on the application of pressure to the internal jugular vein.</p>

<p>The <i>lateral sinus</i> may be laid open in any part of its course, more
especially at the angle of junction between the lateral and sigmoid
sinuses, in close relation to the occipito-mastoid suture, a region not
infrequently involved in basic fractures. The blood effused will
occupy the supra- or infra-tentorial spaces according to the situation
of the rent in the sinus-wall.</p>

<p>The <i>cavernous sinus</i> is frequently involved in anterior and middle
fossa fractures. The blood effused usually escapes into the nose and
mouth.</p>

was mainly intradural, but, as is seen in this figure, the dura mater of the posterior

<h6 class="inline"><b>Symptoms.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The rapid diffusion of blood throughout the subdural<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
space, and the usual coexistence of extensive injury to bone
and brain, seldom permit of the development of such definite symptoms
as might accurately define the localization of the h&aelig;morrhage.
The most important feature in the diagnosis lies in the fact that
compression symptoms are early in onset and progressive in nature.
The &#8216;lucid&#8217; interval, so prominent a feature in middle meningeal
extravasations, is either absent or of such short duration as to be
difficult of recognition. The rapid development of symptoms pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
to brain compression, and the nature of the injury itself should
enable the surgeon, in the majority of cases, to come to the conclusion
that the patient is suffering from diffuse subdural h&aelig;morrhage.
In all cases of doubt, lumbar puncture should be carried out, the
presence of blood-corpuscles in the cerebro-spinal fluid confirming the
diagnosis.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Indications for operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Whether one considers the case
from the point of view of the more immediate prognosis or from the
more remote aspect of the case, operation is indicated, if the condition
of the patient is compatible with such treatment. In considering the
advisability of adopting an active form of treatment, it must be
taken into account that, if the patient recovers without operation,
the presence of an extensive subdural blood-clot must necessarily
interfere, as an after-result, with the functions of the cortex, and
that the removal thereof affords considerable hope of permanent cure.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Operative measures may be considered as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The treatment of the fracture and of the dural rent.</p>

<p>The treatment of the subdural extravasation.</p>

<p><i>The treatment of the fracture and of the dural rent.</i> A scalp-flap
is framed, suited to the occasion and formed with due regard to
existent scalp laceration. The fracture being fully exposed, depressed
or comminuted fragments of bone are elevated or removed. Complete
exposure of the sinus-wall, both in front and behind the site of
laceration, is required, and for this purpose the craniectomy forceps
may be called into requisition. In the event of copious bleeding
during these procedures, strips of gauze should be inserted on either
side of the sinus rent between the dura and the bone, thus compressing
the sinus and stopping the bleeding.</p>

<p>The sinus rent may be treated after one or other of the following
<span class="nowrap">methods:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. It may be sewn up with mattress sutures of fine catgut, by
which means it may be possible to stop the h&aelig;morrhage without
interfering with the sinus blood-stream.</p>

<p>2. The open mouth of the sinus may be puckered up by means
of a purse-string suture.</p>

<p>3. The needle may be passed right round the sinus on either
side of the rent, piercing the falx cerebri in the case of the superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
longitudinal sinus and the tentorium cerebelli in wounds of the
lateral sinus. The two ligatures are then tightened up and the
bleeding controlled.</p>

<p>4. The gauze plugs (see <a href="#Page146">above</a>) may be allowed to remain for
twenty-four hours or more, and then carefully withdrawn.</p>

<p><i>The treatment of the subdural h&aelig;morrhage.</i> Though the complete
evacuation of the clot is seldom practicable, much may be done to
remedy the condition. The tenseness of the dura mater, the absence
of pulsation, and the peculiar plum-colour imparted to that membrane
by the presence of underlying blood-clot point to the nature of the
trouble.</p>

<p>The dura mater is incised and the presenting clot removed, as
far as circumstances permit, with the aid of a spoon and irrigation
(hot saline solution at a temperature between 110&deg; and 115&deg; Fahrenheit).
Free drainage must be supplied, and it is necessary, therefore,
that a counter incision should be made at the most dependent part
of the clot. A suitable region may present itself if the bone be
extensively comminuted. Under other circumstances, a narrow
channel may be cut in the bone, prolonged in the downward direction,
till the lower limits of the clot have been reached (see <a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>).</p>

<h5 class="inline">(<i>B</i>) <b>Localized subdural h&aelig;morrhage (subdural h&aelig;matocele).</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">We are greatly indebted to Bowen<a id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
for our knowledge of
subdural h&aelig;matomata. That subdural h&aelig;morrhage might take the
form of a localized collection was a recognized fact, but the condition
was but little understood, the typical clinical symptoms were not recognized,
and surgeons hesitated to adopt surgical remedies. All these
facts impeded advance in both diagnosis and treatment. Subdural
h&aelig;matoceles, even at this date, are often regarded as rarities, but, in
the light of present knowledge, it would appear that wider recognition
of the h&aelig;morrhage in its clinical aspect will show that such ideas
are erroneous.</p>

<p>In the preceding section it was shown that subdural extravasation
resulting from sinus-injury tends to become diffused throughout the<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
subdural space. With respect to localized h&aelig;morrhages our data
are by no means complete, but all available evidence tends to show
that subdural h&aelig;matoceles are dependent on laceration of the pia-arachnoid
vessels&mdash;a condition practically synonymous with superficial
laceration and contusion of the cortex. The blood, derived
from small cerebral veins and minute cerebral arteries, exercises
primarily but slight pressure effect. Its force is expended on compressing
and emptying the subjacent and surrounding cerebral
vessels, producing, in other words, a condition of <i>local cerebral an&aelig;mia</i>.
This pressure is insufficient to lead to the development of general
compression, but suffices to produce certain rather indefinite symptoms.
We have, therefore, before us a very different picture to that
depicted in cases of middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage. In such extra-dural
h&aelig;morrhages some definite period of time must elapse before
the dura mater is sufficiently stripped from the bone to allow of the
formation of a clot of size sufficing to exercise both local and general
compression effects. Pressure effects then become very manifest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in localized subdural extravasations there is
an immediate effect, for the brain is contused or lacerated. On
recovering from the immediate effects of the injury&mdash;concussion of
a greater or lesser degree of intensity&mdash;the patient does not regain
complete mental and bodily convalescence. He suffers from symptoms
suggestive of brain irritation&mdash;headaches, photophobia, mental
irritability, insomnia, loss of appetite, the pulse accelerated, and the
temperature slightly raised. Later on, more definite symptoms arise,
but, intervening between the day of the accident and the time at which
these more definite localizing symptoms develop, there is an unmistakable
<i>latent</i> period&mdash;a period to be sharply differentiated from the
previously mentioned <i>lucid</i> interval (see <a href="#Page139">p. 139</a>).</p>

<p>This &#8216;latent&#8217; period lasts for a variable period of time&mdash;seldom
less than a week or more than three months. At the end of that time
the picture changes, and the patient evidences symptoms obviously
referable to local brain compression. From a clinical point of view
it is fortunate that subdural h&aelig;matoceles tend to involve the fronto-parietal
region with the consequent development of motor symptoms,
especially paresis or paralysis of the contra-lateral side. Hence the
name sometimes applied to the condition&mdash;traumatic late apoplexy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
The speech areas are implicated if the injury be situated on the left
side. Paralysis limited to the lower extremity is exceedingly suggestive,
such a palsy occurring only with the greatest rarity in extra-dural
h&aelig;morrhages (from the middle meningeal artery).</p>

<p>If the pressure be unrelieved by operation the patient passes
from the excitatory to the paralytic stage of brain compression,
gradually falling into a condition of coma, the pulse increasing in
frequency and the respiration becoming more and more embarrassed.</p>

<p>In the study of this condition, the following are the points to
which special attention should be <span class="nowrap">paid:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The comparative want of severity with respect to the injury
received.</p>

<p>2. The absence of any &#8216;lucid&#8217; interval, such as is present, for
example, in middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>3. The presence of a definite &#8216;latent&#8217; period.</p>

<p>4. The late development of symptoms pointing to general and
local brain compression.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be stated in general that the more indefinite
and the more deferred the pressure symptoms, the greater the
probability that we have to deal with a localized subdural h&aelig;morrhage.
Lumbar puncture may materially aid in the differential
diagnosis between extra-dural and subdural h&aelig;morrhages.</p>

<p>The following case affords a typical example of subdural
<span class="nowrap">h&aelig;matocele:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>An elderly man fell down, striking the right side of the head
against the pavement. He lost his senses for a few minutes and was
then brought to the hospital, dazed and complaining of headache
(note the absence of any <i>lucid</i> interval). He was sent home in a cab
and was assisted to bed by his wife. He kept to his bed during the
next week, complaining of constant headache, and was exceedingly
irritable (this is the &#8216;latent&#8217; period). Towards the end of the third
week his wife noticed that he seldom used the left upper and lower
extremities. This paresis increased steadily, the face was drawn to
the right side, and his condition became so serious that the wife
brought him again to the hospital (this is the &#8216;manifest&#8217; period).</p>

<p>When seen by me he was only partly conscious, the mental
condition varying, however, during the day. He was exceedingly
irritable, muttering to himself in a low tone, words being more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
less unintelligible. The left upper extremity was paralysed, the
face drawn to the right side, and the left lower extremity was but
little used. The pupils were equal, the disks normal. The temperature
in the left axilla was two degrees lower than on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>The h&aelig;matocele was exposed, cleared out, and the cavity
drained. Recovery was rapid and complete. Two years later all
was well.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<h6 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The lesion is usually of so gross a nature that little
difficulty will be experienced in determining the site for trephining.
The protective gauze and scalp-tourniquet are applied as usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
(see <a href="#Page14">p. 14</a>), and a bradawl introduced through the scalp so as to
indent the external table and allow of the subsequent accurate
application of the trephine. A scalp-flap, suited to the occasion, is
framed, the skull trephined, and the disk of bone elevated and removed.
The appearance of the dura mater now allows the operator to verify
his diagnosis&mdash;the membrane is non-pulsatile, it bulges markedly
outwards and presents a blue-purple colour. The bone is then nibbled
away in the downward direction towards the lower limit of the clot,
the scalp incision being prolonged according to requirements.</p>

<p>In the region of the trephine-hole the dura is incised in a crucial
manner, and the four flaps held aside by catgut sutures passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
the apex of each flap. A blunt director is introduced beneath the
dura, passing towards the lower limit of the clot, and the membrane
slit up to within a short distance of the lower margin of the gap.
All meningeal vessels that cross the line proposed for dural section
must first be underrun on either side of that line. Retraction of the
dura will now allow of adequate exposure of the underlying h&aelig;matoma.
Its removal can be carried out with the aid of a spoon, and by means
of gentle irrigation (hot saline at a temperature between 110&deg; and
115&deg; Fahrenheit). It is usually impossible to remove the whole of
the coagulum, but the greater portion can be got rid of in the manner
described.</p>

<p>The dura mater is approximated above by the cross-union of the
four apical sutures, whilst the downward prolongation is also sutured
except at the most dependent point, where a rubber drainage-tube
is inserted beneath the dura mater and brought out through the
scalp-flap (see <a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>). This tube should be anchored to the dura
mater with a single fine catgut suture.</p>

<p>The tube should be allowed to remain in position for at least
thirty-six hours. In this the surgeon must be guided by the amount
of discharge and the general progress of the case.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Results.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The most complete results obtained by operative

<h5 class="inline"><b>Pia-arachnoid h&aelig;morrhage.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">From evidence obtained at
post-mortem examinations, it may be concluded that the great
majority of cases of severe head-injury&mdash;especially those in which
&#8216;irritation&#8217; of the brain is a prominent feature&mdash;are associated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
pia-arachnoid h&aelig;morrhage. This is evidenced by the presence of
a film of blood and serum over certain regions of the brain, not
confined to the region subjacent to the skull area primarily involved,
but also present over the opposite pole of the brain (injury by contre-coup).</p>

<p>Subpial h&aelig;morrhage differs from the subarachnoid variety in
that the blood follows the invaginations of the pia mater, lining,
therefore, both major and minor cerebral sulci. Subpial and subarachnoid
h&aelig;morrhages are, however, generally co-existent, and the
term&mdash;pia-arachnoid h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;aptly describes the conditions
commonly found.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> resulting from such blood extravasations are
such as are described in the sections dealing with concussion and
irritation of the brain (see <a href="#Page166">p. 166</a>).</p>

<h3>INJURY TO THE BRAIN</h3>

<p>Injury to the brain must always be regarded as by far the most
important of the many complications associated with fracture of the
skull. A fracture is not necessarily accompanied by brain-injury,
and laceration of the brain may exist without a fracture. There can,
however, be no question that the more severe cases of head-injury
are almost invariably associated with some degree of brain-injury&mdash;varying
from contusion to extensive laceration, cortical or central.</p>

<p>No part of the brain is exempt from injury, but two regions, the
antero-inferior aspect of the frontal lobe and the antero-external
aspect of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, show a special liability to
contusion and laceration.</p>

<p>The brain may be injured immediately subjacent to the site at
which the blow is delivered (direct injury), or at the pole directly
opposite that at which the blow was applied (indirect injury).</p>

<p>Direct injury results from the in-driving of comminuted and
depressed fragments of bone, from the passage of a foreign body, and
from the direct transmission and diffusion of forces through the
subjacent cerebral substance.</p>

<p>The indirect forms of injury are less readily explained. Their
frequency cannot be disputed. I drew attention to the subject in
my Hunterian Lectures in 1904, there stating that indirect injury<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
to the brain was more common than the direct form. My opinion
is confirmed by Phelps,<a id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who states that injury by indirect violence
is of almost constant occurrence.</p>

<p>Three theories have been advanced in <span class="nowrap">explanation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. &#8216;Their production has been ascribed to the change in form
that is suffered by a skull in virtue of its elasticity when subjected
to violence which causes distortion of the brain to the point of
bursting.&#8217;</p>

<p>2. &#8216;In the displacement of the cerebro-spinal fluid by the consecutive
depression and bulging that is believed to follow a blow on the
head; a momentary vacuum is formed at either axis of force, and the
vessels of the brain and meninges rupture from lack of support.&#8217;</p>

<p>Neither of these theories are tenable, insomuch as they are based
on an acceptance of the &#8216;bursting and compression&#8217; theories (see <a href="#Page74">p. 74</a>)&mdash;theories
which, in my opinion, it is impossible to accept.</p>

<p>3. The &#8216;contre-coup&#8217; theory. According to this theory the injury
is due to sudden and violent displacement of the brain against the
opposing osseous barrier. This theory has been opposed by many&mdash;notably
by Helferich&mdash;on the ground that the brain is said to completely
fill the cranial cavity, and that &#8216;shaking&#8217; from side to side
is impossible.</p>

<p>This theory affords, however, the most satisfactory explanation
of contralateral laceration. The following points may be advanced
in its <span class="nowrap">favour:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes are more liable to
contusion and laceration than any other parts of the brain, both
regions possessing certain anatomical relations accounting for their
ready injury. The frontal pole is related to the angle of junction
between the horizontal and vertical plates of the frontal bone, the
temporo-sphenoidal lobe to the cul-de-sac, at the anterior part of the
middle fossa, that is overhung by the wings of the sphenoid bone.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The lacerated area is almost invariably situated at that part
of the brain which lies opposite to the region struck in the line of the
transmitted force. Furthermore, brain lesions are most prevalent
when the accident results from a fall from a height, a class of accident
in which &#8216;shaking&#8217; of the brain is most likely to occur, and least<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
common when the basal fracture is dependent on a bilateral compression
force.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The statements that &#8216;shaking&#8217; cannot take place, and that
the soft cerebral substance cannot be driven forcibly and violently
against the opposing bony barrier, so as to be locally bruised and torn,
are incorrect.</p>

<p>That such violent displacement of the brain can and does occur
is proved by the following <span class="nowrap">case:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="casestudy">

<p>A prize-fighter was knocked out by a blow on the right side
of the head, dying a few hours later. The post-mortem revealed no
fracture of vault or base, but a linear laceration of the brain on the
mesial aspect of the right hemisphere which exactly corresponded
to the free margin of the falx cerebri. In this case, therefore, conclusive
evidence was obtained that the brain had been driven from
right to left against a firm and resisting barrier, corresponding
laceration resulting.</p>

</div><!--casestudy-->

<p>The lacerated area is usually cone-shaped, the base corresponding
to the surface of the brain, the apex facing towards the lateral
ventricles. In the most severe cases the anterior or lateral horns
of the lateral ventricles may be involved at the apex of the cone,
and, in the event of further cerebral softening, the horns of the
ventricles may, as it were, bulge outwards, thus assisting in the
formation of those traumatic cephaloceles that communicate between
the lateral ventricle and the surface of the brain.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the degree of laceration be slight and the
injury compatible with life, organization and partial resolution takes
place, with the formation, in nearly all cases, of adhesions between the
cortex and the membranes, of false membranes, arachnoid cysts, and
of blood cysts. In the more serious cases cerebral fibrosis results,
in direct proportion to the degree of cerebral destruction, with corresponding
degeneration, both of the cerebral cortex and of the tracts
that evolve therefrom.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptoms.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Certain regions of the brain may, when injured,
give rise to localizing symptoms. More generally, however, all
localizing features are obscured by an overpowering element&mdash;the
presence of concussion, irritation, or compression of the brain.</p>

<p>Still, in some cases, the localizing features are sufficiently marked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
at some period of the case, to allow of a more definite diagnosis. The
symptoms, therefore, must be considered under the two heads,
(A) <i>localizing</i>, and (B) <i>general</i>.</p>

<h5><b>A. Localizing symptoms.</b></h5>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing to the frontal lobes.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Phelps,<a id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> from a series of 130
cases, arrived at the following conclusions&mdash;that, &#8216;in nearly every
case in which consciousness was retained or regained, and the mental
faculties not perverted by general delirium, laceration of the left
frontal lobe was attended by default in intellectual control, and that
the lesion was usually of the anterior region and implicated its inferior
surface.&#8217; &#8216;Subcortical disintegration was characterized by abrogation
of mental power, and superficial laceration by aberration in its
manifestations.&#8217; And secondly, that, &#8216;in nearly every instance in
which laceration was confined to the right side, the mental faculties
remained unaffected, except as they were obscured by delirium and
stupor occasioned by coincident general lesion.&#8217;</p>

<p>Although the above statements have not altogether been confirmed
by cases that have come under my observation, yet, coming
from such a source, they must be accepted unless refuted.</p>

<p>Bianchi states that, after extirpation of the frontal lobe of the
ape, the whole intellectual life of the animal is changed. Perception,
attention, inhibition, and in particular memory and association are
enfeebled. The psychical tone is lowered; the ape lacks initiative,
courage, and spirit.</p>

<p>Laceration of the under aspect of the lobe may, by direct involvement
of the olfactory region, interfere with the faculties of smell and
taste.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing to those parts that minister to the function of speech.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The condition of the patient usually prevents one from obtaining
early information as to the power of speech. Isolated lesions of the
posterior part of the third left frontal convolution result in <i>motor
aphasia</i>, a condition characterized by the inability on the part of
the patient to speak, in spite of the fact that comprehension is unimpaired.
The brain-injury is, however, seldom so defined as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
be characterized by loss of speech without other phenomena. In
very close relation to the area responsible for speech is the <i>writing</i>
centre, situated at the posterior end of the middle frontal gyrus,
near the centre for the movements of the hands and fingers. Injury
to this centre results in <i>agraphia</i> and <i>alexia</i>.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Word-deafness</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">results from lesions implicating the upper temporo-sphenoidal
lobe, and <i>word-blindness</i> from injuries to the supramarginal
and angular gyri (see <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57. The Areas concerned in Speech Expression.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Phelps pointed out that the lesion must be an extensive one if the
symptoms included under the term <i>sensory aphasia</i> (word-blindness,
word-deafness) are to be evolved. No localized injury to any small
area suffices, and the cortex must be deeply involved. Lacerations
of the brain are usually of so gross a nature that further differentiation
is seldom to be obtained. Here it might be noted that the cortical
centres responsible for speech and its accessories, word-seeing, word-writing,
and possibly word-hearing, are all situated on the left side
in normal right-handed individuals. The corresponding areas on the
right side may be regarded as &#8216;silent&#8217; areas, and may be utilized, if
desired, for decompression purposes. No operation, with that purpose
in view, should be carried out, however, unless the surgeon is assured
that the patient is right-handed in his actions. A case has recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
come to my knowledge where a right-parietal decompression operation
was carried out with disastrous results.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The relation of sensory
aphasia to lesions of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe has already been
mentioned. The anterior poles of this portion of the brain, a region
frequently involved in head injuries, may lead to the development of
impaired smell and taste, especially if the lesion includes the uncinate
lobe and be situated on the left side. In other respects, the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe may be regarded as a &#8216;silent&#8217; area of the brain.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing to the pre- and post-central convolutions.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Injury to
the pre-central or motor area usually leads to the development of
definite symptoms&mdash;twitchings, convulsions, or paralysis of the face
and extremities on the contra-lateral side. In the earlier stages
reflexes are abolished. Later on, as the result of degenerative changes
in the pyramidal tracts, spasticity, contractures, and rigidity, with
increased reflexes will be observed in the affected limbs. On the
other hand, the muscles do not show any reaction of degeneration.
Babinski&#8217;s sign is generally present.</p>

<p>Injury to the post-central convolutions might be expected to
lead to various alterations in tactile and muscle sense, in stereognosis,
and in sense of pain and temperature, but the general condition of
the patient seldom permits accurate demonstration. Such sensory
disturbances are more frequently observed as late results of head-injury.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing of the occipital lobes.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Laceration of the occipital lobes
may lead to homonymous hemianopia, for which defect it is probable
that the degree of laceration must be considerable, involving mainly
the mesial aspect of the occipital lobe (see <a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>). Sch&auml;fer has
shown that the greater portion of the occipital lobe may be removed
in monkeys without producing loss of vision, and it is only when
the lesion involves the parieto-occipital fissure and passes into the
occipito-temporal convolutions that loss of vision is permanent.</p>

<p>Slighter degrees of occipital injury may lead to subjective symptoms,
such as flashes of light, colour changes, &amp;c.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Localizing to the cerebellum.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Lesions of the cerebellum rarely
permit of the development of such localizing symptoms as are observed
in cerebellar tumours. Inco-ordination of movement, ataxia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
other symptoms observed in cerebellar tumour formation are, from
the general condition of the patient, incapable of demonstration in
cerebellar laceration. It is necessary, however, to draw attention
to the significance of yawning and gaping. This symptom has been
observed in several recent cases, and, as far as my observation goes,
is only present in cerebellar lesions.</p>

</div>

<p>In the consideration of these localizing symptoms, it must be
borne in mind that brain lacerations are of an exceedingly gross
nature, and that there may be&mdash;as the late Professor von
Bergmann<a id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
pointed out&mdash;&#8216;notwithstanding the severest brain symptoms, not the
slightest discoverable anatomical alteration in the brain. On the
other hand, notwithstanding the absence of all brain symptoms,
extensive and striking destruction of the brain substance.&#8217;</p>

<h5><b>B. General symptoms.</b></h5>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Concussion or cerebral shock.</b></h6>

<p><i>Its pathology.</i> Concussion used to be regarded as implying
a &#8216;molecular disturbance&#8217; of the brain&mdash;a definition so unsatisfactory
that it may be relegated to a desired obscurity. At the
present day, though some difference of opinion exists as to whether
the condition is or is not necessarily dependent in its development
on associated cortical or subcortical lesions, macroscopical or microscopical,
concussion is regarded as implying a condition of <i>acute
cerebral an&aelig;mia</i> through sudden inhibition or paralysis of the vaso-motor
centre.</p>

<p>With respect to the existence of visible lesions of the brain,
Kocher maintains that such lesions&mdash;h&aelig;morrhages and the like&mdash;are
necessarily present, proposing that the term &#8216;brain concussion&#8217;
should be eliminated in favour of &#8216;brain contusion&#8217;. On the other
hand, the late Professor von Bergmann pointed out that such a course
was not possible, instancing the many cases of concussion where
contusion could not possibly have existed.</p>

<p>There cannot, in my opinion, be any question as to which is the
correct view. It is unreasonable to ask one to believe that the milder
cases of concussion, cases in which the patient merely suffers from
loss of consciousness for a few minutes, from which he rapidly recovers
and is discharged from treatment within a few days, and from which
he suffers in the future from no remote ill effects whatsoever, it is
unreasonable to ask one to believe that such cases have experienced
so severe a lesion as brain contusion or laceration. Both these conditions
would require a long period of convalescence, and would
tend to leave in their train very serious after-results.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that there exists a degree of concussion
from which the patient can quickly and entirely recover. It is also
clear that in many cases the patient passes through a long and serious
illness, whilst, in some cases, a fatal termination may ensue&mdash;and
that too within a few hours. It is consequently clear that we have
to deal with varying grades of concussion, some of which are of so
mild a nature as to be clearly unassociated with definite cerebral
lesion, whilst others are of so serious a nature that death may take<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
place within a few hours, and in such cases the gravest cerebral
lesions may be found at the autopsy.</p>

<p>In other words, it would appear that concussion is more or less
dependent in its severity on the degree of associated cerebral change.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the milder type of case that we should turn
in order to determine what is exactly meant by concussion. In such
cases the patient merely suffers from a mild degree of <i>cerebral shock</i>,
a condition closely resembling shock in general. &#8216;Shock&#8217; is defined
as a &#8216;condition resulting from fall in blood-pressure, due to inhibition
or paralysis of the vaso-motor centre&#8217;. The afferent impulses that
pass up the various sensory paths inhibit or paralyse the vaso-motor
centre, a centre that has for its main function a tonic constricting
influence on the peripheral arteries. Hence, these vessels dilate
atonically, the blood collects in the great splanchnic area, and,
insomuch as the cerebral arteries possess no separate vaso-motor
apparatus, they passively follow the changes in the general circulation.
The brain is consequently in a state of arterial an&aelig;mia, the arteries
relatively emptied, the veins passively engorged.</p>

<p>Clinically, concussion or cerebral shock differs from ordinary
shock in one manifestation only&mdash;sudden loss of consciousness. This
development is readily explained on the ground that concussion
results from a violent blow applied in the near neighbourhood of the
vaso-motor centre, with consequent <i>sudden</i> vaso-motor depression and
<i>acute</i> an&aelig;mia of the cerebral cortex. This leads to immediate great
fall of blood-pressure, loss of consciousness, and lack of muscular
control.</p>

<p>Statements have recently been brought forward to the effect
that concussion is in reality a mild type of compression. This view
received at first sight some confirmation from the experiments of Koch
and Filehne, who, from the application of consecutive slight blows to
the heads of dogs, showed that each blow resulted in bulbar stimulation
followed by bulbar depression. The blows being continued, the
degree of stimulation decreased and that of depression increased
until exhaustion and death resulted. During the periods of stimulation
the pulse-rate slowed, during those of depression it increased.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that concussion, as observed in the
human being, results from one sudden and violent blow. It may,<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
I think, safely be assumed that, in such cases, the stimulating effect
of the blow is entirely abolished in favour of an acute depression.
And, as Archibald<a id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
says, &#8216;their records of respiration, pulse, and
blood-pressure resemble far more closely the course of an increasing
compression, with its gradual slowing of pulse and respiration and
steady rise of blood-pressure, than that of concussion with its sudden
standstill of pulse and respiration and fall of blood-pressure.&#8217;</p>

<p>In <i>favourable cases</i> the injury being of a comparatively mild
nature, the vaso-motor centre soon recovers tone, and, as the result
of previous depression, the vascular conditions are now reversed&mdash;<i>the
stage of depression</i> giving place to the <i>stage of reaction</i>. The blood-pressure
rises, the carotids pulsate forcibly, the face is turgid and
flushed, the skin hot and moist, whilst the temperature rises, and the
general cerebral hyper&aelig;mia is evidenced by headache, restlessness,
and perhaps by delirium.</p>

<p>In the <i>more severe cases</i> the vaso-motor depression is unduly
prolonged, or persists till death, the patient remaining concussed for
a considerable period of time, or dying in that condition. In these
fatal cases the post-mortem examination <i>usually</i> reveals brain
laceration, but <i>always</i> evidences considerable engorgement of superficial
cerebral veins, increase of cerebro-spinal fluid and &#339;dema, both
of the pia-arachnoid region and of the brain substance itself. These
latter phenomena are accounted for by the fact that, insomuch as
the venous pressure and cerebro-spinal tension are equal, the greater
the engorgement of the cerebral veins the more extensive is the
transudation of fluid into the pia-arachnoid and cerebral systems.
In a fatal case of concussion&mdash;recently under my care&mdash;the surface
of the cortex, when exposed by operation, was obscured by a layer
of &#339;dematous pia-arachnoid <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in depth.</p>

<p>Arguing from the presence of the very definite pathological
changes observed in all fatal cases&mdash;contusions, lacerations, h&aelig;morrhages,
and &#339;dema&mdash;one may arrive at the conclusions (1) that lesions
of a similar but less serious nature are existent in the serious but
non-fatal cases, and (2) that the prolongation of the stage of depression
is directly dependent on the presence of such lesions.</p>

<p>On investigating the numerous cases that come under the care<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
of the surgeon, certain features present themselves which are not
always readily explained on the definition of concussion as given
above. Thus, the variability of the symptoms evinced in cases of
concussion admitted into hospital are well exemplified by the following
table, compiled from a consecutive series of 50 cases admitted
into St. Bartholomew&#8217;s, diagnosed and treated as <span class="nowrap">concussion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Still, when all is considered, concussion and compression are but
ill-defined from one another, both in their clinical and pathological
aspects. The more indefinite cases of concussion are probably such
as border on compression, the increasing &#339;dema gradually carrying
the patient across the border line between the two conditions.</p>

<p>In the present state of our knowledge respecting concussion or
cerebral shock it may, I think, be accepted (1) that concussion is
dependent on an acute inhibition or paralysis of the vaso-motor
centre; (2) that the milder cases are unassociated with any pathological
visible changes; (3) that the prolongation and severity of the
depression stage are directly proportionate to the extent of the brain
lesion, such lesions varying from &#339;dema and contusion to extensive
h&aelig;morrhages and lacerations.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Its symptomatology.</b></h6>

<p><i>The stage of depression.</i> The symptoms are evoked immediately
on the receipt of the blow, the patient falling to the ground from lack
of muscular control and loss of consciousness. The muscular system
is completely relaxed, the limbs, when raised, falling helplessly to
the ground. The face is deathly pale, the eyes usually open, fixed,
and expressionless, the pupils equal, commonly dilated and responsive
to light. The patient <i>may</i> be aroused by strong stimuli&mdash;pinching,
shouting in the ear, pressure over the supra-orbital nerves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The pulse is small, slightly accelerated, and occasionally intermittent.
The respiration is weak, shallow, and often irregular. The
temperature is lowered, sometimes to such an extent that it cannot
be registered on the thermometer. The surface of the body is cold
and clammy, beads of sweat standing out on the brow. The deep
reflexes are abolished. Some attempts may be made at swallowing
when fluids are placed in the mouth.</p>

<p>Urine is often expelled at the time of the accident, and, more
rarely, f&aelig;ces may also be passed involuntarily.</p>

<p>The condition either gives place to that of reaction or the state
of unconsciousness and collapse becomes more profound, in which
case the prognosis is most unfavourable.</p>

<p><i>The stage of reaction.</i> Weak, purposeless movements are observed
and the patient may sigh heavily, mutter, or groan. This is followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
by profuse vomiting, after which the temperature begins to rise, the
body becomes warmer, and the patient recovers his senses either
entirely or in part. The heart beats strongly, the pulse being full and
slightly accelerated in rate. The carotid arteries are seen to pulsate
forcibly, the face is flushed and moist. The patient is restless, and
complains of severe headache, due in all probability to intradural
hypertension. Under efficient treatment these symptoms of cerebral
hyper&aelig;mia abate, the patient recovering quickly or slowly, according
to the severity of the blow. Retrograde amnesia is often a conspicuous
feature in the more severe cases, varying greatly in depth and
character, seldom permanent.</p>

<p>In the more serious cases&mdash;those associated with severe cerebral
injury&mdash;the pupils dilate fully and do not react to light. Corneal
reflex is absent. The medullary centres gradually become exhausted,
the pulse becoming smaller, increasing in rapidity, and finally unrecognizable.
Respiration becomes weaker and often Cheyne-Stokes
in character. Respiration ceases before the heart gives out.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Cerebral Irritation.</b></h6>

<p><i>Its pathology.</i> Sufficient evidence is supplied, both by clinical
symptoms and by post-mortem examination, to show that brain
irritation is dependent on definite brain lesions, these varying from
&#8216;bruising&#8217; to minor degrees of laceration. Bruising or contusion of
the brain&mdash;evidenced by pia-arachnoid h&aelig;morrhages and by cortical
and subcortical h&aelig;morrhages&mdash;is most prevalent in the frontal and
temporo-sphenoidal regions. The same may be said with respect to
laceration.</p>

<p><i>Its symptomatology.</i> From the initial stage of concussion the
patient passes into that of irritation, the reaction being of a rather
violent type and accompanied by considerable rise of blood-pressure.</p>

<p>The patient lies curled up in bed, the lower extremities flexed at
the hip and knee, the upper limbs bent across and partially covering
the forwardly flexed head. He is exceedingly restless. Restraint is
usually required. The eyes are tightly closed, and all attempts at
pupillary examination are strenuously resisted. The patient groans,
mutters, and uses language, perhaps suited to the occasion but not
adaptable to polite society. Headache is severe, often referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
the frontal region. The skin is hot and dry&mdash;burning&mdash;the body
temperature is raised whilst the pulse is accelerated and its tension
increased. Both urine and f&aelig;ces may be passed into the bed, not so
much from loss of bladder and rectal control as from transitory moral
perversion.</p>

<p>The state of irritation subsides or merges into that of cerebral
compression.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Compression.</b></h6>

<p><i>Its pathology.</i> A compression force&mdash;whether foreign body,
blood extravasation, abscess or tumour&mdash;must act on the brain
substance or on the fluid constituents of the skull. The brain, however,
is itself incompressible. It may be squeezed like a sponge, but
its actual structure is unalterable. Consequently, the compressing
force exercises its main influence on the fluid contents, driving out
the cerebro-spinal fluid, depleting the cerebral veins and emptying
the arterioles, producing in other words a state of brain an&aelig;mia.</p>

<p>Experimentally, it has been ascertained that from 3 to 6 per cent.
of the cranial capacity can be taken up by a foreign body without
producing compression symptoms&mdash;probably owing to the escape of
cerebro-spinal fluid into the spinal canal, and the recession of the
medulla and cerebellum into the foramen magnum. Furthermore,
it would appear that the incidence of compression symptoms is
associated with depletion of those cerebral veins which are in closest
relation to the compression force. As this force increases&mdash;for
example, in middle meningeal h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;the pressure exercised
on the surrounding regions increases proportionately, to the level
of the capillary pressure, and even to that of the smaller arteries.
A state of cerebral an&aelig;mia results, first localized to the region
primarily involved, then invading more widely and finally affecting
both supra- and infra-tentorial spaces.</p>

<p>With regard to the continuity of pressure between these three
spaces, there is but little pressure discontinuity between the two
supra-tentorial spaces, whilst, between the supra- and infra-tentorial
regions, there is less ready communication.</p>

<p>A slight degree of compression in the supra-tentorial space will act
on the corresponding space only, greater degrees will involve all<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
three. On the other hand, a rise of infra-tentorial pressure is not
of necessity associated with a corresponding elevation in the other
two regions. For example, a cerebellar tumour readily affects the
medullary centres, whilst the higher cortical regions are for the time
being totally unaffected. Again, a tumour situated in the frontal
pole does not necessarily produce any of those symptoms of cerebral
compression which are regarded as referable to an increase of subtentorial
pressure&mdash;slow pulse, vaso-motor disturbances, subnormal
pressure, and deep rhythmical respiration.</p>

<p>Returning once more to the vascular effects of a localized compression,
it is obvious that whilst the compressing force is producing
a surrounding an&aelig;mia&mdash;depleted veins and arterioles&mdash;yet that the
neighbouring but more distant brain is venously engorged&mdash;from
venous retardation. Insomuch, moreover, as the venous tension and
cerebro-spinal pressure are equal, it is obvious that, as the result of
venous engorgement, there is some surrounding serous transudation
into the perivascular, pia-arachnoid, and cerebral regions.
The brain bordering on the an&aelig;mic area is therefore &#339;dematous,
the &#339;dema diminishing and fading away in direct proportion to
the distance of the area involved from the primary focus of
compression.</p>

<p>If the compression force is of a progressive nature, the engorged
area becomes in turn an&aelig;mic, and still more distant regions become
engorged and &#339;dematous. This state is known as that of <i>progressive
&#339;dema</i>. Its complete development is largely dependent on brain
infection&mdash;abscess of the brain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the symptoms of compression develop
are largely dependent on the producing cause. Thus, three examples
may be <span class="nowrap">cited:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Compression of slow development, requiring weeks or months
before typical symptoms are observable&mdash;e. g. tumour formation.</p>

<p>(2) Compression of medium development, requiring days only:
e. g. abscess, subdural h&aelig;matocele, and some forms of middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>(3) Compression of acute development, almost immediate:
e. g. diffuse subdural h&aelig;morrhage, some cases of middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage, depressed fractures, and intracranial foreign bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span></p>

<p>The special symptoms of compression are, as Leonard Hill
pointed out, referable to the effects produced on the bulbar centres.
That such is the case is suggested by the following <span class="nowrap">facts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The same compression symptoms result wherever the compressing
force acts.</p>

<p>(2) Experimentally, an increased pressure in the posterior fossa
produces compression symptoms earlier than when the compressing
force is exercised in some more distant region of the brain.</p>

<p>(3) A fracture involving the posterior fossa gives rise to compression
symptoms earlier than a fracture in some more distant
region.</p>

<p>(4) A far smaller body kills in the bulbar region than in the
cerebral chamber.</p>

<p>(5) The general pressure effects are in no way due to excitation
of the part of the brain pressed on, for, after division of the mesencephalon,
the pressure was just as active in calling forth changes in
respiration and circulation (Sir Victor Horsley).</p>

<p>Leonard Hill also pointed out that the first effect of an&aelig;mia of
the bulbar region was in the nature of stimulation, the vaso-motor
centre being influenced in such a manner as to produce a general
rise of blood-pressure. A further degree of compression may again
produce the same result, the arterial pressure rising considerably
above the normal. Later on, the medullary centres&mdash;and more
especially the vaso-motor&mdash;become exhausted, with consequent grave
fall in blood-pressure. The pulse, previously slow and full, becomes
rapid, small, readily compressible, and irregular in rhythm, whilst
the respiration, previously deep and regular, becomes gasping,
irregular, and Cheyne-Stokes in character.</p>

<p>The sequence of events may be depicted in another manner. In
cerebral compression, the battle&mdash;as pointed out by Sch&uuml;ster&mdash;largely
resolves itself into a life and death struggle between the attacking
compression force on the one hand and the defending vaso-motor
centre on the other.</p>

<p>Up to a certain point the vaso-motor centre holds the whip-hand.
The capillary an&aelig;mia as produced by the compression force&mdash;cerebro-spinal
tension, &amp;c.&mdash;brings about a condition which not only
acts as a stimulus to the vaso-motor centre but also exercises a marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
effect on the vagus and respiratory centres. The blood-pressure
rises, the pulse is slowed in rate, and its tension markedly increased,
whilst the respiration is slightly irregular both in depth and rhythm.
The vaso-motor centre thus attacked sends out further impulses so
as to raise the blood-pressure to slightly above requirements. The
bulbar centres are again flushed with blood, the vaso-motor centre
&#8216;slacks off&#8217;, and the blood-pressure falls again.</p>

<p>The compressing force is, however, still active and full of fight.
A further capillary an&aelig;mia results. The vaso-motor centre again
responds and the blood-pressure rises higher than ever, the pulse-rate
is further slowed, and the respiration is deeper, less regular, and even
stertorous.</p>

<p>This combat continues, and, in the presence of an active compression
force, there is that rhythmic activity of the vaso-motor
centre which is represented by the well-known Traube-Herring
curves; again, the height to which the vaso-motor centre drives the
blood-pressure may be taken as representing the activity of the
compression force.</p>

<p>When the compressing force rises above a certain limit the
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> occurs&mdash;the vaso-motor centre retires from the fight, there
is a rapid fall in blood-pressure, the medulla is emptied of blood, and
both cardiac and respiratory centres share in the defeat (rapid pulse
of poor volume and Cheyne-Stokes respiration).</p>

<p>These being the effects as exercised by compression on the bulbar
centres, one must not omit to consider the results produced on the
higher cortical centres. An&aelig;mia is the feature and unconsciousness
is the ultimate result, preceded by headache and drowsiness progressing
on to stupor and coma. Intermediate between the stages
of sleepiness and coma, one observes occasionally a stage of irritation&mdash;such
as is pictured in many cases of typical middle meningeal
h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>In fatal cases the respiratory centre gives out first, the heart
often beating for some time after all attempts at respiration have
ceased. In a case recently under my care, respiration ceased during
the process of trephining. The patient was kept &#8216;alive&#8217; for three
hours by means of artificial respiration, and under such mechanical
breathing the patient retained a good colour and the heart worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
well. So soon, however, as efforts were relaxed, the pulse became
weaker and weaker until further artificial respiration again restored
the balance. This process was kept up till it was realized that the
respiratory centre was &#8216;dead&#8217;.</p>

<p>From these facts, it may be assumed that the special symptoms
of compression are dependent (<i>a</i>) on an&aelig;mia of the bulb&mdash;with
corresponding cardiac, respiratory, and vaso-motor changes; and
(<i>b</i>) on an&aelig;mia of the cortex&mdash;with unconsciousness.</p>

<p><b>Its symptomatology.</b> According to Kocher, the following are
the four stages of <span class="nowrap">compression:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>The stage of compensation.</i> A mild degree insufficient to
seriously compromise the circulation. Cerebro-spinal fluid escapes
into the spinal canal and some of the venous radicles are compressed.
Some venous engorgement. Some headache, possibly some focal
symptoms. Some mental dullness.</p>

<p>2. <i>Stage of beginning compression.</i> Beginning failure of the
circulatory compensation. Headache pronounced, vertigo, restlessness,
excitement or delirium. Objective symptoms of venous stasis&mdash;dilatation
of the veins of the eye, both external and internal, &#339;dema
of the disk. Affection of the medullary centres, shown by a slowed
pulse and a slight rise in temperature.</p>

<p>3. <i>Stage of fully-developed compression.</i> Widespread capillary
an&aelig;mia. Medulla affected markedly. The period of vaso-motor
regulation has set in with its high blood-pressure, and this, with its
vagal quality, gives the pulse its bounding character. The rise in
blood-pressure shows a definite rhythm. Also rhythmicities in
respiration which may acquire the Cheyne-Stokes character. Rhythmic
alterations in the size of the pupils, with alternate increase and
decrease in the depth of stupor, so that the &#8216;up-wave&#8217; causes the
patient to moan, become irritable, and thrash about, whilst the &#8216;down-wave&#8217;
sees him completely comatose. Pulse is markedly slowed and
the disks evidence pronounced &#8216;choking&#8217;. Reflexes are abolished,
cyanosis extreme, respiration snoring.</p>

<p>4. <i>Stage of paralysis.</i> Irregular cardiac and respiratory efforts,
pulse grows rapid, coma deepening, muscular relaxation, pupils
widely dilated, and permanent fall in blood-pressure. Respiratory
paralysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span></p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Treatment.</b></h6>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Of concussion.</i> In considering the treatment of concussion,
it has to be remembered that we are treating a condition dependent
on vaso-motor depression, and that we are ignorant&mdash;at any rate
for the time being&mdash;as to the nature and extent of a possible cerebral
lesion. It is obvious, therefore, that although we are clear as to the
general lines on which treatment is to be carried out, yet that our
earlier methods must be expectant and our subsequent methods
symptomatic. In other words, we must be prepared, at any moment,
to change the method of treatment according as symptoms demand.</p>

<p>The more general treatment&mdash;applicable to all cases, of whatever
severity&mdash;consists in putting the patient to bed with the head low,
in the application of warmth to the body and extremities, and in the
administration of hypodermic injections of morphia, a drug of great
value in the more severe cases of concussion. It must, however, be
administered with caution, lest important symptoms be masked.</p>

<p>Strychnine and brandy are practically useless. They merely
whip the willing horse&mdash;the heart is doing full duty and cannot be
further stimulated by such measures.</p>

<p>In <i>mild and moderately severe cases</i> this form of treatment will
suffice to tide the patient over the collapse stage and induce the
stage of reaction. So soon as this <i>commences</i>, the rising temperature
and vomiting heralding the change, the head of the bed should be
lowered, hot bottles and blankets removed&mdash;the patient being covered
with a linen sheet only&mdash;and all forms of stimulant avoided.</p>

<p>Calomel should be given by the mouth, 1 to 5 grains, according
to the age of the patient. Headache may be relieved by applying
ice-bags to the head, by tying round the forehead a handkerchief
soaked in a weak solution of eau-de-Cologne, and by the administration
of various drugs, more especially aspirin (10 grs.), antipyrin
(10 grs.), and hyoscin (gr. <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub>).</p>

<p>In <i>more severe cases</i> more radical measures must be adopted
to combat the severe vaso-motor depression, with its consequent
splanchnic congestion and cerebral an&aelig;mia. No method is more
desirable than infusion. This method, with its attendant advantages
and disadvantages, has been detailed on <a href="#Page118">p. 118</a>. It is merely necessary
to add that infusion must not be carried out in a haphazard manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
Its application is based on scientific principles, and its results must
be noted with the greatest care. The surgeon must keep a watchful
eye on the temperature and blood-pressure, and he must be prepared
at any moment to change his plan of campaign.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Of irritation.</i> The patient should be kept in a darkened room
and should not be worried more than is absolutely necessary for
diagnostic purposes. An attendant is usually required, whose methods
should be persuasive rather than forcible. Great tact is required.</p>

<p>Morphia is of the greatest value in the treatment of this condition.
It relieves the headache, acts as a damper on the hyper&aelig;mic
brain, and keeps the patient from threshing about in bed and injuring
himself. Sleep is essential for an early recovery and cure.</p>

<p>In the <i>more severe cases</i> venesection should be carried out, and
operative measures will be required if the rising temperature and
slowed high-tension pulse herald the advent or indicate the presence
of compression of the brain.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Of compression.</i> The various operations carried out for the
relief of compression of the brain are discussed elsewhere. They
include such operations as are conducted for localized h&aelig;morrhages,
whether subdural or extra-dural (see <a href="#Page135">Chap. V</a>), and such also as are
described as &#8216;decompression&#8217; operations (see <a href="#Page121">p. 121</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to the general indications for adopting active
surgical measures, the surgeon is, of course, guided in his estimation
of the case by the general condition of the patient&mdash;depth of unconsciousness,
&amp;c.&mdash;but more especially by the temperature changes
and alterations in blood-pressure. In my own practice I am guided
very largely by the temperature changes&mdash;as described on <a href="#Page114">p. 114</a>.
On the other hand, some surgeons pin their faith more especially
on the blood-pressure changes. Thus Archibald writes: &#8216;If the
blood-pressure be 130 mm. Hg. on admission, an hour later 150,
still later 200 or 250, we are immediately in possession of the fact
that the available intracranial space is being steadily, dangerously
reduced, and that the vaso-motor centre is straining every nerve to
stave off defeat.&#8217;</p>

<p>I am, of course, ready to concede the great value of blood-pressure
tracings, but, in my experience, the temperature changes
have been even more consistent, so much so that I base my treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
of a case very largely on such changes. One word of warning&mdash;the
temperature must be taken every half-hour, and active surgical
measures adopted <i>so soon as</i> the rising temperature, slowing high-tension
pulse, and deepening unconsciousness point to advancing
compression.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a growing tendency amongst those who
have carefully studied the effects of trauma on the skull and brain
to carry out exploratory and decompression operations at an early
period, even in cases which present no symptoms of special localizing
significance. The pathological conditions so commonly found and
the excellent results that have been obtained prove that the adoption
of early surgical treatment is founded on a very sound basis.</p>

<h4 class="inline blankbefore75"><b>Points in the differential diagnosis between traumatic
and other forms of coma.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline blankbefore75">The previous history of the case, the
nature of the accident, and the lesions found may enable the surgeon
to arrive at ready diagnosis. Often, however, it is impossible to exclude
non-traumatic forms of coma without an exhaustive examination
of the patient. In the process of examination, it is convenient
to have in one&#8217;s mind a simple memoria-technica. Thus,</p>

</table>

<p>To this list must be added Diabetic Coma.</p>

<p>Having these conditions in mind, the patient is examined from
head to foot in the following <span class="nowrap">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>vault of the skull</i> is first examined and all evidence obtained
as to the presence and extent of external injury.</p>

<p>The <i>ears and nose</i> are investigated for escaping blood or cerebro-spinal
fluid, important symptoms in the diagnosis of fracture of the
base.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are next examined. Ocular palsies suggest injury or
apoplexy; h&aelig;morrhages&mdash;subconjunctival or palpebral&mdash;point to<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
injury; whilst the condition of the pupils and disks may offer valuable
information. Thus:</p>

<p>In concussion, the pupils are equal, dilated, but responsive to
light.</p>

<p>In irritation, they are equal but contracted.</p>

<p>In compression, they are either equal, dilated and fixed, or
unequal.</p>

<p>In alcohol, they are more or less normal, except in the deeper
stages of intoxication, when they are dilated and irresponsive to light.</p>

<p>In apoplexy, dilated and fixed, or unequal. Pin-point in pontine
h&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>In epilepsy, usually equal and responsive.</p>

<p>In opium, immovably and symmetrically contracted.</p>

<p>In ur&aelig;mia, dilated and sluggish.</p>

<p>In diabetes, equal but dilated. React to light.</p>

<p>In doubtful cases an examination of the disks may clear up the
diagnosis. The presence of albuminuric retinitis, optic neuritis and
atrophy (diabetes and ur&aelig;mia), retinal h&aelig;morrhages (injury), offer
material diagnostic aid.</p>

<p>The <i>tongue</i> should be examined for such biting as is observed in
epilepsy. The odour of the <i>breath</i> is investigated&mdash;the sickly smell
of alcohol, the sweetish odour of ur&aelig;mia, the peculiar smell of opium,
the chloroform-like smell of diabetes.</p>

<p>The appearance of the <i>face</i> may be suggestive. The unilateral
facial palsy of trauma and apoplexy; the stertorous respiration,
puffing out of the cheeks, and general turgidity of compression,
ur&aelig;mia, apoplexy and deep alcoholism; the quiet breathing and
pale face of concussion, opium poisoning, and of post-epileptic and
diabetic coma.</p>

<p>The <i>urine</i> should be examined for albumen and sugar, and the
body and lower extremities for &#339;dema.</p>

<p>The <i>extremities</i> are investigated with respect to unilateral palsy,
a condition only present in trauma and apoplexy. General convulsions
point to injury, ur&aelig;mia, and epilepsy. Resistance to
manipulation is suggestive of alcoholic excess. Unilateral palsy may
be associated with corresponding alteration in the deep reflexes.</p>

<p>The <i>pulse</i>-rate and the condition of the arteries supply valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
evidence. The coats may be atheromatous, whilst the slow, full pulse
is strongly suggestive of compression, apoplexy, and alcoholism.</p>

<p>The <i>temperature</i> should be taken on both sides of the body. A rise
of temperature is usually dependent on brain injury, apoplexy, and
alcoholism. In opium poisoning, ur&aelig;mia, and epilepsy the temperature
is more likely to be normal or subnormal. In pontine h&aelig;morrhage,
hyperpyrexia is commonly observed.</p>

<p>Some difference in the temperature on the two sides of the body
points to injury or apoplexy.</p>

<p>The <i>depth of the coma</i> is often of the greatest assistance in the
differential diagnosis. Thus, in concussion, alcohol poisoning, and in
the minor grades of epilepsy and ur&aelig;mia, the patient may often be
sufficiently aroused by shouting in the ear, digital pressure over the
supra-orbital nerves, or by the application of the battery, as to give
some account of the accident, &amp;c. In compression, in the deeper states
of ur&aelig;mic and diabetic poisoning, and in the status epilepticus, the
patient can seldom be aroused from the deep coma into which he is
sunk.</p>

<p>In all cases of doubt the patient must be kept under careful
observation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="chapname">THE REMOTE EFFECTS OF HEAD-INJURY</span></h2>

<h3 class="inline"><b>General considerations.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">It is often stated that a patient who
has received a severe head-injury is &#8216;never the same man afterwards&#8217;.
Before accepting such a sweeping statement&mdash;the gravity of which
is obvious&mdash;it is essential that an extensive survey should be made
into the remote effects of head-injury, and, in their consideration, the
surgeon must not be biased by those cases that seek hospital relief.
It is the unfavourable cases that present themselves for examination,
the more favourable are usually lost to view. Furthermore, whether
the early results are completely satisfactory or not, but little guide
can be obtained into the more remote results unless, as a routine
procedure, an attempt be made to trace all such cases in their after-history.
The more remote results can then be estimated at their
true value.</p>

<p>The difficulties attendant on all attempts at following up hospital
cases are considerable, and consequently we are greatly indebted to
Crisp English<a id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
for his tabulation and discussion on the after-history
of 300 cases treated at St. George&#8217;s Hospital&mdash;300 cases personally
investigated at periods varying from one to twenty years subsequent
to the time of the injury.</p>

<p>English&#8217;s conclusions have been compared with those derived
from my own personal experience, with the result that they were
found to coincide so closely that they may be accepted as affording
an accurate guide into the remote results of head-injury in general.</p>

<p>English classified his cases into three series&mdash;each 100 in number&mdash;according
to the severity of the lesion.</p>

<p>Series 1. Fracture cases.</p>

<p>Series 2. Cases of concussion, contusion, and laceration.</p>

<p>Series 3. Miscellaneous cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span></p>

<p>The remote results as observed in the first and second series
were as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="dontwrap" summary="Results">

<tr>

</table>

<p>In the 200 cases, therefore, that come under Series 1 and 2,
79 experienced no ill effects from the injury, 92 developed slight
effects, and definite defects were present in 29 cases.</p>

<p>Before alluding further to the mental and bodily condition of the
patients subsequent to the accident, including their wage-earning
capacity, it is necessary to enlarge on the fact that the depreciation
in mental and physical faculties depends, not only on the severity
of the injury, but also on the age, disposition, and status of the
patient.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>The effect of age.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">All evidence tends to prove that head-injuries
in the young and the old are more serious than when the accident
occurs during middle life. In the old, the power of repair is impaired;
in the young, the developing faculties are impeded in their
progress.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>The effect of disposition.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">The temperament of the patient must
always be taken into consideration, the neurotic type seldom recovering
so quickly or so completely as the more plethoric.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>The effect of status.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">A complete recovery is far more likely to
occur when the status of the patient allows of complete rest, bodily
and mental, for some considerable time subsequent to the accident.
A premature return to work, with possible added family troubles,
invariably acts as a deterrent to complete recovery. In the milder
cases a few weeks suffice to allow of restoration to health, in other
cases an interval of at least one year should be allowed before the
patient again takes up his duties. It is obvious, therefore, that family
troubles and business emergencies influence to a marked degree
the completeness of recovery. It might be anticipated that the
financial necessities of the case would cause the various after-results of<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
head-injuries to be more marked amongst the labouring classes. The
personal equation, however, enters largely into the question, and due
allowance must be made for the greater financial and social losses
entailed when the injury involves one who occupies a high social
sphere. It must also be borne in mind that those occupying such
spheres may not benefit from the Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Act.</p>

<p>On referring again to English&#8217;s cases, it was found that the wage-earning
capacity of the patient afforded a valuable clue in the
estimation of the remote results in general. Thus in Series 1 and 2
the following results were <span class="nowrap">obtained:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Series 1. 86 cases:</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Thus 59 per cent. in Series 1 and 80 per cent. in Series 2 were

<p>It will be of interest to compare English&#8217;s results with those
obtained by other investigators. Thus, in 48 cases examined by

<p>On investigating those cases reported by English, in which the
patient was compelled to take on lighter work or change his vocation,
one at once encounters a diversity of symptoms, some so indefinite
as to be included under the term traumatic neurasthenia, others so
distinct as to fall naturally under certain well-recognized groups,
such as traumatic cephalalgia, epilepsy, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Traumatic neurasthenia.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">All those cases characterized by
the indefinite nature of their complaint require the most careful
sifting&mdash;to separate the wheat from the chaff&mdash;for there is always
a certain proportion of malingerers, such as realize the pecuniary
advantages of their position. When these are excluded, a large class
remains in whom the injury must undoubtedly be regarded as the
<i>fons et origo mali</i>. A curious and interesting train of symptoms
supervene after the accident, indefinite from a localizing point of
view, but quite definite from the standpoint of the patient himself.
Mental irritability, with a ready tendency to fly into a passion&mdash;Kaplan&#8217;s
explosive diathesis&mdash;may be regarded as an almost constant
symptom. The patient is changed in his manner towards those near
and dear to him, restless, irritable, and intolerant of noises, morose,
and incapable of managing his financial affairs.</p>

<p>The change may be insidious in origin, but, in the absence of
appropriate treatment, steadily progressive. The mental changes,
unless checked in time, tend to merge into definite insanity, not
infrequently of a homicidal or suicidal character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span></p>

<p>Insomnia, with terrifying dreams, loss of appetite, emaciation,
headache, vertigo, nervousness, amnesia, lack of power of mental
concentration, and mental depression are all noticeable features. All
such symptoms are aggravated by indulgence in alcohol, exposure to
the sun, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From a localizing point of view the symptoms are obscure, but
they are probably none the less dependent on pathological changes&mdash;thickening
of the meninges, effusion into the subdural and subarachnoid
spaces, &#339;dema of the cortex, &amp;c. Furthermore, it will
usually be found that, during the height of the attacks, the pulse-rate
is slowed, the temperature raised, and the respiration embarrassed&mdash;symptoms
suggestive of cerebritis and alterations in the intracranial
pressure.</p>

<p>In exploratory operations conducted in cases of this nature,
I have been particularly struck by the fact that in a large proportion
of cases one finds what appears to be a condition of local &#339;dema&mdash;some
fluid beneath the dura mater, and a greater excess of the same
in the pia-arachnoid meshwork. This &#339;dema is a manifest condition
readily demonstrated to onlookers. I am not an advocate of ventricular
puncture in these cases, mainly on the ground that it complicates
the operation and brings no added benefit in its train, but in such cases
as it has been carried out the jet of cerebro-spinal fluid proves the
added existence of an increased intraventricular pressure. From
Leonard Hill&#8217;s experiments it would appear that this &#339;dema is
dependent on chronic vascular changes&mdash;arterial an&aelig;mia, venous
congestion, and cerebro-spinal and serous accumulation.</p>

<p>At a later date the meninges may become thickened and adherent
to one another and to the surface of the brain, whilst false membranes
and arachnoid cysts may develop.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">For these more general and indefinite remote
results of head-injury the treatment comprises <span class="smcap lowercase">REST</span>, bodily and
mental, light diet, fresh air, cheerful but quiet surroundings, and
encouragement. Potassium iodide and mercury (preferably by
inunction) often do good, whilst phenacetin and antipyrin are perhaps
the best drugs for relief of headache. For sleeplessness potassium
bromide is perhaps the best remedy.</p>

<p>I have found in some cases that Turkish baths and massage have<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
brought about considerable improvement. In advising such energetic
treatment the surgeon must be guided by the case before him, these
measures being more or less restricted to the less serious and more
chronic cases.</p>

<p>In the more serious cases, especially when slowing of the pulse
during the height of the attacks and some blurring of the disks point
to a probable increase of intracranial pressure, operative measures
must be considered. The greatest circumspection is required in
determining the class of cases in which operation may be proposed,
and the surgeon must be most guarded in his prognosis. So far as
my personal experience goes, the operation has invariably brought
about some amelioration in the condition of the patient, whilst
now and again a complete cure may be anticipated. Those cases
which on exploration evidence an &#339;dema of the brain are the least
favourable; those in which the surgeon finds a subdural cyst or
h&aelig;matoma offer the best prognosis.</p>

<p>With respect to the details of the operation, two courses are
available: (1) examination of the meninges and brain at the seat
of injury, and (2) a &#8216;decompression&#8217; operation. The former course
should be adopted whenever the local conditions are favourable, that
is to say, whenever depression or absence of bone, localized headache,
&amp;c., suggest a localized lesion. Under other circumstances Cushing&#8217;s
intermusculo-temporal method of decompression should be carried
out. This operation should be conducted first over the right temporal
region, thus avoiding all possibility of inclusion of Broca&#8217;s area,
a similar operation being done on the left side at a later date in the
event of incomplete success.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Traumatic cephalalgia.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Of all the after-results of head-injuries,
headache is the most constant symptom, either localized to
the region primarily involved or diffuse. Even when diffuse, however,
the aching is frequently referred to the frontal region. Localized
headaches are the more acute. The patient can place his finger over
the site of the trouble with accuracy and constancy. Examination
on the part of the surgeon causes him to wince or cry out. Percussion
with the tip of the finger not only leads to marked exacerbation but
also induces a dull aching sensation, which lasts for some time
afterwards. Whether acute or dull, exacerbations are of frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
occurrence, and during these attacks the patient is entirely
incapacitated, desiring nothing more than to be left alone.</p>

<p>In some cases the pain is referred along the course of one of the
superficial nerves, in which case it is probable that the affected nerve
is caught up in the scar.</p>

<p>Headache, of whatever nature, is increased by exertion, indulgence
in alcohol, exposure to the sun, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Crisp English considers that many cases of localized headache
are dependent on a localized chronic osteitis, and recommends
trephining and removal of the affected bone. There can be no doubt
that the mere removal of a disk of bone will occasionally bring about
a cure, but, from my own experience, I take a different view with
respect to the pathological lesions present. I have operated on over
a dozen cases of chronic cephalalgia, and I have found in nearly
every case definite pathological lesions&mdash;depression of internal table,
thickening of the meninges, subdural cysts and subdural h&aelig;matomata.
The mere removal of a disk of bone may relieve the symptoms by
reducing the local pressure or by removing a source of meningeal
irritation, but such treatment seldom brings about permanent relief.
The dura mater should be opened in nearly every case, the frequent
discovery of a subdural complication&mdash;cyst or h&aelig;matoma&mdash;showing
that such a course is necessary.</p>

<p>These patients suffering from chronic headache are often pitiable
subjects, spending their time in wandering from doctor to doctor,
from hospital to hospital, seeking relief. They are only too eager
to obtain benefit from surgical intervention. The greatest care is
required in deciding as to operative procedures. Injudicious surgical
measures are not only disappointing to both surgeon and patient, but
also discreditable to this branch of surgery. On the other hand,
it must be acknowledged that remedies other than surgical are
generally inefficacious. The surgeon, therefore, takes considerable
responsibility on his shoulders when he states that an operation is
inadvisable. Though guarded in my prognosis, I generally advise
operation on the ground that it is impossible to foretell the cause
of the headache, and brilliant results may be obtained.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">When the headache is diffuse, <span class="smcap lowercase">REST</span>, aided by the
administration of phenacetin, &amp;c., may exercise some effect. Operative<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
treatment should not be recommended unless the intensity
of the attack, blurring of the disks, and slowing of the pulse suggest
that there is some increase in the general intracranial pressure.
Under such circumstances, exploration should be carried out over
the region at which the injury was received. In the absence of evidence
with respect to external injury, a subtemporal decompression
operation is the operation of election.</p>

<p>When the pain is localized to some special region, the outlook is
more favourable. Operative measures should then always be carried
out over the painful spot. A scalp-flap is framed according to the
region which it is desired to expose, the disk of bone removed, and
the meningeal territory examined. For detailed operative technique,
see <a href="#Page20">p. 20</a>.</p>

<p>When the pain is referred along the course of one of the scalp
nerves, it may be relieved by alcohol injections (see <a href="#Page314">p. 314</a>), or by
exposure of the nerve, followed by removal of at least 1 inch of its
trunk.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Traumatic epilepsy.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">When epilepsy arises after a head-injury,
it is almost the invariable rule that the attacks should partake <i>at first</i>
of the focal or Jacksonian type. A case of traumatic epilepsy should,
therefore, possess the following <span class="nowrap">characteristics:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The fit should be preceded by some sensory or motor aura&mdash;the
aura corresponding to the region of the brain primarily involved.</p>

<p>2. The fit should always start by twitchings of the parts supplied
by the motor area which is in direct relation, or in close proximity,
to the site of dural or osseous lesion.</p>

<p>3. The fit may remain localized to the region first affected, or,
as is more commonly the case, may spread to other regions. In the
latter case the various motor areas are affected in a certain definite
order, according to their cortical arrangement. Thus, a fit arising
from irritation of the right cortical face-area leads first to twitchings,
then to convulsions, and perhaps finally to paralysis on the contralateral
face-muscles, the movements then spreading from the face to
the upper extremity, and from the arm through the trunk to the
lower extremity. When the fits become generalized, spreading to
the opposite side of the brain, the cortical areas are affected in the
reverse order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span></p>

<p>4. The patient should retain consciousness throughout the attack.</p>

<p>5. The fits should not be succeeded by any paresis or paralysis.</p>

<p>Later on, when the fits become more frequent and severe, they
lose their typical Jacksonian characters, the various regions being
affected so rapidly one after the other that all focal symptoms tend
to be obscured. The fits are then often associated with definite loss
of consciousness, and succeeded by paresis or paralysis of the parts
primarily affected. The patient also usually complains of lassitude or
headache, this lasting some hours after the termination of the fit.</p>

<p>Traumatic epilepsy does not always partake of the typical
Jacksonian type. Sometimes the fits are so sudden in onset and
violent in character that, from the first, the more typical features
are absent. Again, fits of the focal or Jacksonian type do not necessarily
imply that some pathological causative agent will be found
on exploration. Ordinary epilepsy sometimes partakes of the focal
type. I have myself operated on three cases of focal epilepsy, deceived
by their Jacksonian characteristics, and found nothing abnormal.
On the other hand, in all these cases definite and permanent improvement
was observed subsequent to the surgical procedures.</p>

<p>It might also be added that encouraging reports are to hand,
not only in cases of idiopathic epilepsy with focal symptoms, but
also in cases without focal symptoms. A decompression operation
is carried out on the basis of Kocher&#8217;s statement to the effect that
the fit is immediately preceded by a rise of intracranial pressure, for
which a safety-valve must be supplied&mdash;such as is afforded by an
intermusculo-temporal operation of decompression. Whether Kocher&#8217;s
statement is correct or not, the fact remains that some cases of
idiopathic epilepsy, without focal symptoms, benefit considerably
from operation.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The localizing symptoms of traumatic epilepsy.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">When the
cause of the trouble is situated over the motor area&mdash;the pre-Rolandic
cortical strip&mdash;the fits should commence by twitchings of the fingers,
toes, corners of the mouth, &amp;c., according to the site of the lesion.
The fits are seldom preceded by any sensory aur&aelig;, though occasionally
such may be the case, for even at the present day some doubt exists
as to whether the precentral area should be regarded as purely
motor or sensori-motor. In other cases, the patient, without being<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
able to state definitely his sensations previous to the onset of the fit,
may be able to foretell its immediate development, and still more
rarely he may be capable of aborting the fit or diminishing its
intensity by grasping firmly or massaging the region of the body in
which the fit first develops.</p>

<p>When Broca&#8217;s motor speech-area is primarily involved, the fits
are preceded by difficulty in phonation, mumbling of words and
incoherence, grinding of the teeth, &amp;c., the fits then rapidly spreading
to the parts responsible for the movements of the muscles of face
and upper extremity.</p>

<p>When the fits arise from a post-central source of irritation, they
are usually preceded by well-marked sensory aur&aelig;&mdash;tinglings, burning
and painful sensations&mdash;again according to the region affected.</p>

<p>When preceded by sensations of taste and smell, the lesion is probably
situated over the anterior part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.</p>

<p>When by visual impressions&mdash;flashes of light, &amp;c.&mdash;the lesion is
probably situated over the occipital lobe of the brain.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Pathology.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The pathological conditions responsible for the
development of fits are various, resolving themselves, when fully
investigated, into two main groups: those associated with meningeal
changes only, and those accompanied by definite cortical scarring
and tract degeneration.</p>

<p>In the event of osseous deficiency the scalp is usually more or
less adherent to underlying structures, and the gap in the skull filled
with dense fibrous tissue, which is itself adherent to the membranes
of the brain and perhaps to the brain itself.</p>

<p>In the absence of osseous deficiency, the cerebral irritation is
usually dependent on depressed fragments of bone, on subdural
h&aelig;matomata and cysts, and on meningeal thickening.</p>

<p>In the event of cerebral degenerative changes it may be presumed,
whether there is a deficiency in the bone or not, that considerable
matting of meninges and cortex is existent with pyramidal
degeneration.</p>

<p>In the absence of evident signs of external injury, cases of focal
epilepsy in the young require careful investigation, inquiry being
made as to difficult labour, for, as Harvey Cushing points out, &#8216;When
we consider the widespread lesions associated with those cases that<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
later on are recognizable as Little&#8217;s disease, and that presumably an
enormous number of children receive at birth some trifling injury
which, from lack of symptoms, is overlooked, may it not be that
many cases of so-called idiopathic epilepsy dating from childhood
can be safely attributed to the effects of early traumatism?&#8217;</p>

<p>In all these, and in other doubtful cases, before undertaking
surgical procedures, the surgeon should obtain the services of a skilled
neurologist.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The clinical course of the case.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">If a typical case of Jacksonian
epilepsy can be observed from beginning to end, many curious
and interesting features will be observed. The fits, at first typically
Jacksonian, gradually lose their typical character, becoming more
frequent and less focal in nature, the patient losing consciousness
during the fit, and the fits succeeded by weakness or paralysis of the
parts primarily involved. The general mental state of the patient
suffers proportionately&mdash;he becomes morose, despondent, irritable,
homicidal, or suicidal in tendency. How far these retrograde symptoms
are dependent on degenerative processes in the brain, and how
much they result from the moral effect of the frequent epileptiform
seizures, are questions that can only be determined by observing the
effect of treatment, surgical or otherwise. Some cases respond
readily to treatment, others are too far advanced to experience any
material benefit, some end their days in the lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>In any case, surgical treatment, if adopted at all, must be carried
out before definite brain-degeneration arises&mdash;such changes being
evidenced by spasticity of the limbs, exaggerated knee-jerks, &amp;c.
When such pathological changes are existent, there can be but
little hope of benefiting the patient.</p>

<p>Further points in the clinical course of the case, and such also
as throw further light on the pathological conditions present, will be
obtained by a survey of 21 cases that have come under my own care
or close observation.</p>

</table>

<p>Some lesion, such as might be accepted as responsible for the
development of the fits, was discovered in 17 out of 18 cases. Duret&#8217;s
experience tends to bear out the view that some pathological lesion
will be found in almost every case. In 67 cases reported the following
conditions were <span class="nowrap">found:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="conditions">Depression of bone, 27 cases.<br />
Splinters of the internal table, 15 cases.<br />
Cysts, subdural, 4 cases.<br />
Thickening of membranes, 7 cases.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Operation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">When the localization of the trouble is suggested
by the presence of focal symptoms, and by a corresponding scalp- or
bone-injury, no difficulty need be experienced in determining the
site of exploration. When the fits are associated with definite focal
symptoms, but without the supplementary evidence obtained by
visible signs of external injury, exploration should be conducted over
that region of the brain from which the fits appear to emanate. In
the absence of all localizing brain symptoms, operative measures
should be carried out over the site of scalp or bone lesion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span></p>

<p>Whatever the circumstances of the case, the preliminary details
are identical. The scalp is shaved, cleansed, the head enveloped in
gauze, and the scalp-tourniquet applied.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The formation of the scalp-flap.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">When the scalp is adherent
to the bone, the incision, carried throughout down to the bone, is made
in such a manner that the flap will not only allow of the detachment
of the scar, but will also permit of the complete exposure of the
neighbouring portion of the skull.</p>

<p>When the scalp is adherent to dura or brain, as the result of
osseous deficiency, the edge of the knife should be directed towards
the under aspect of the flap, and the flap carefully peeled away from
the region of the gap.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>The examination of the bone.</b></h6>

<p><i>When no fracture is found</i>, the operator should trephine over the
cortical area from which the trouble appears to emanate.</p>

<p><i>When a fissured fracture is found</i>, trephining is carried out where
the line of fracture cuts across that region of the brain which appears
to be involved.</p>

<p><i>When a depressed fracture is found</i>, the trephine is applied in such
a manner that the circle just includes the outer segment of the
depression. After removal of the disk, the dura mater should be
peeled away from the under surface of the bone, and the whole of
the depressed area cut away with the craniectomy forceps.</p>

<p><i>When there is osseous deficiency and when the gap is filled in with
fibrous tissue</i>, adherent to the margins of the gap and probably to
the dura or brain as well, it is essential that this fibrous tissue should
be freely removed. All evidence goes to substantiate the statement
that meningeal irritation is the main cause of the fits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The removal of this tissue is best carried out by beginning at the
most promising part of the gap, detaching the tissue adherent to the
most prominent portion of the bone, and exposing the underlying
dura mater. The central mass of scar tissue should then be seized
with forceps, lifted up and detached as completely as possible, both
from the margins of the gap and from the underlying dura or brain.
In the more complicated cases, where the scar tissue is adherent to
dura and brain, the most careful dissection is required, and in many
instances it is necessary to include that part of the dura mater which<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
is incorporated with the scar. The cerebral substance should be
carefully protected (see below).</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The treatment of the dura mater.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">When the dura has not
been injured during the process of exposure, pulsating freely, and
presenting a normal appearance, preparations can be made to close
in or protect the gap in the skull.</p>

<p>When the membrane bulges outwards, and when, in other
respects, the indications point to an increase of intradural pressure,
the dura must be incised in a crucial manner, and further investigation
carried out in the search for a subdural h&aelig;matoma, arachnoid cyst, or
other lesion. A h&aelig;matoma is washed out and drained, an arachnoid
cyst shelled out or treated by excision of the parietal wall (see <a href="#Page204">p. 204</a>).</p>

<p>When the dura is thickened, matted, and adherent to the brain,
it is picked up at the least adherent part and carefully dissected away,
exposing the pia-arachnoid region. The surface of the brain being so
brought into view, the scalpel and dissecting forceps may be required
to remove all tags and shreds of matted tissues, this process being continued
till a reasonably healthy region has been brought into view.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The treatment of a cortical scar.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">There is no reason why
a superficial scar should not be freely removed, but, unfortunately, this
procedure is necessarily followed by the formation of another scar,
at least as extensive as the original fibroid condition. The removal
of cortical scars has therefore justifiably fallen into disrepute, and
most surgeons content themselves with an exposure of the pia-arachnoid
region, the actual cerebral substance being left intact.
All bleeding must be arrested, blood extravasation merely favouring
the formation of fresh adhesions.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The prevention of fresh adhesions between the dura and
the brain and between the scalp and the dura or brain.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&#8216;It is
useless to talk about the prevention of fresh adhesions; they form
in spite of anything that may be done&#8217; (English). With this statement,
I am in complete accord. It has been recommended that fresh
egg-albumen, gutta-percha tissue, silver foil, &amp;c., should be inserted
beneath the dura or between the scalp and the brain. Experience
shows, however, that all these substances are useless, being invaded
or surrounded by granulation tissue, and, later on, absorbed by or
enclosed in dense fibrous tissue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span></p>

<p>The formation of adhesions between the scalp and the dura or
brain can, however, be effectually prevented by the insertion of
plates, &amp;c. (see <a href="#Ref02">below</a>).</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>The closure or protection of gaps in the skull.</b></h6>

<p><i>Indications for operative treatment.</i> Large defects, post-operative
or traumatic.</p>

<p>Small defects situated over exposed portions of the skull or over
the more important regional areas.</p>

<p>Both large and small defects associated with chronic headache,
insanity, Jacksonian epilepsy, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Certain congenital defects in the vault.</p>

<p>Small defects, unless situated in exposed regions or associated
with symptoms, seldom demand protection.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft"><b>Methods.</b></h6>

<p><i>(a) The formation of bone-flaps, derived from neighbouring parts
of the skull, from some other bone of the patient, or from the bones of
a freshly-killed animal.</i></p>

<p><i>(b) The interposition of plates of some foreign material between the
scalp and the bone, or the insertion thereof into the osseous deficiency.</i></p>

<p><i>(a) Bone-flaps. The osteoplastic method of K&ouml;nig and M&uuml;ller.</i>
Two flaps are framed in the manner described below, and the two
interchanged in position. A &#8898;-shaped flap, comprising the whole
thickness of the scalp, is turned down so as to expose the region of
the deficiency, the margins of the incision lying about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch outside
the margin of the gap. The flap is dissected from underlying structures
to which it may be adherent, care being taken to avoid injury
to the blood-vessels entering at the base of the flap.</p>

<p>A second flap is framed from the scalp immediately to one side
of the first flap. This second flap corresponds in size and shape to
the one already framed, but differs in that its base points in the
opposite direction. It is also peculiar in that it consists of the whole
thickness of the scalp plus the external table of the skull. The scalpel
is carried down to the bone, and the margins of the incision retracted
in such a manner as to allow of the application of the hammer and
chisel. The external table is cut through along the line of the scalp
incision and split away from the rest of the bone. The two flaps are<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
now interchanged in position and sewn down with a few salmon-gut
sutures.</p>

The scalp-flap; <i>b.</i>, The
osteoplastic flap; <i>g.</i>, The gap in the skull.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The osteoplastic flap is by no means easy to frame, the external
table tending to split up during the process of separation; moreover,
its formation is confined to the upper-occipital and parietal regions
of the skull, regions where the two tables are separated by diploic
tissue. In the temporal and cerebellar regions this method cannot be
adopted, and in the frontal region the deformity and scarring act as
a bar to such operative procedures.</p>

<p>In suitable cases, however, good results may be obtained by this
method. Asepsis is essential to success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span></p>

<p>Bone-flaps derived from some other bone of the patient (e. g. the
tibia), or from the bones of a freshly-killed animal (e. g. the scapula
of a dog), seldom yield satisfactory results. The gap in the skull is
first exposed, the margins refreshed, and the size and shape estimated.
The bone-graft is then cut from the other bone, suited in every
respect to the deficiency, inserted in the gap and sewn into position.
The graft, however, seldom retains its vitality, being invaded by
granulation tissue, and converted, in the course of time, into dense
fibrous tissue. Furthermore, in the event of the slightest failure of
aseptic technique, it acts as foreign body and must be removed.</p>

<p>The attendant difficulties and the frequent failures of these
auto- and hetero-transplantations of normal bone lead to the utilization
of decalcified, calcined, and boiled bone-plates. Between these
there is very little to choose, for, whether due to the absence of
calcium salts or the destruction of bone-cells, they merely act as
scaffolding media for the formation of fibrous tissue and are more or
less completely absorbed.</p>

<p id="Ref02"><i>(b) Plates of some foreign material.</i> The following method has
been found to give the most satisfactory results. Plates of pure
annealed silver are utilized, <sup>9</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> inch in thickness (No. 2 Birmingham
metal gauge). The plates are light and of fair malleability. Supposing
now that it is required to protect a deficiency in the vault&mdash;irregular
in shape, round or oval, it matters not&mdash;the maximum antero-posterior
and vertical diameters are measured and a piece of silver
cut out, which is about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch greater in both diameters. The convexity
of the skull in the region of the gap is estimated and the plate
hammered into corresponding shape. This is readily carried out by
placing the plate on a heavy leaden base and hammering to the
required convexity. The convexity is regulated by the site of application
of the blows, the heavier being applied to the central or apical
portion of the plate, the weaker to the periphery. A rough general
convexity is so produced. The edges of the plate are smoothed with
the file, and a few holes bored to allow of the escape of any blood
or cerebro-spinal fluid that might tend to collect beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550" id="Fig60">

<img src="images/illo199.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="549" />

irregular dotted line); <i>sc.</i>, The scalp-flap.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The plate is then boiled and applied as follows. The osseous
defect is exposed by a scalp-flap&mdash;not including pericranium&mdash;the
margin of the scalp-flap lying <i>at least 1 inch</i> external to the margin<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
of the gap.<a id="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The flap is dissected down so that its base is situated
<i>not more than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch</i> below the lower limit of the gap. The pericranium
is then stripped away towards the periphery. The plate is
applied so that it rests below against the base of the scalp-flap, lies
throughout between the scalp and bone, and overlaps the margins
of the gap by about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch. The pericranium is heaped up around
and over the margins of the plate, and the scalp-flap replaced. The
plate is maintained in position by the support received from the base<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
of the flap, marginally by the pericranium, and generally by the
reposition of the scalp-flap.<a id="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In the process of time, new bone is
formed by the pericranium, this and fibrous tissue developing along
the line of the scalp incision fixing the plate accurately and firmly
in position.</p>

<p>Needless to say, absolute sterility of the field of operation and
of all media is essential. In the event of failure in cleanliness,
however slight, it will become necessary to reopen the wound and
remove the plate. In such cases a second attempt may be made
at a later date.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Results.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The results attained by operative treatment must
always be considered under two headings: the immediate and the
more remote.</p>

<p>The immediate results are almost always of a satisfactory nature,
the fits being more or less completely controlled, or so diminished in
quantity and quality as to satisfy both surgeon and patient. Such
early results may be regarded as the general rule, and some enthusiasts
believe that the ultimate results are equally satisfactory. However,
in following up these cases, it will be found that, in a considerable
proportion of cases, the more remote results are by no means so
satisfactory. A complete and permanent cure is seldom obtained,
though the great majority of cases evidence considerable improvement,
the fits recurring, though less frequent and less intense than
previous to the operation.</p>

<p>The results which may be obtained should therefore be considered
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Cases of complete and permanent cure.</p>

<p>Cases of definite amelioration.</p>

<p>Cases in which no benefit is derived.</p>

<p>In 20 cases that have come under my own care, the following
results were <span class="nowrap">obtained:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Complete cure in 2.</p>

<p>Marked improvement in 14.</p>

<p>No change in 4.</p>

<p>Cushing reports on 128 cases of traumatic epilepsy, operative<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
measures being adopted in 58, 40 cases of focal epilepsy and 18
exhibiting no localizing feature. The results were as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>12 cases were free from attacks for from 1 to 5 years.</p>

<p>30 were greatly improved or showed some improvement.</p>

<p>17 exhibited no change.</p>

<p>2 died in status epilepticus.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Traumatic insanity.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Traumatic insanity is closely allied to
traumatic epilepsy, occurring, as a general rule, late in the history
of the case, when the frequency of the fits and the associated disturbance
of the higher faculties breaks down the mental and moral
control of the patient.</p>

<p>The particular form of insanity varies according to the circumstances
of the case. Kraft Ebbing reported on 42 cases, the disease
partaking of the following <span class="nowrap">types:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>18 cases of mania.</p>

<p>13 cases of dementia.</p>

<p>&#8199;5 cases of dementia with epilepsy.</p>

<p>&#8199;3 cases of general paralysis.</p>

<p>&#8199;3 cases of melancholia.</p>

<p>Of 104 cases reported by Christian,</p>

<p class="padl4">16 were of dementia.</p>

<p class="padl4">29 of mania.</p>

<p class="padl4">47 of general paralysis.</p>

<p class="padl4">12 were of epilepsy.</p>

<p>Mania&mdash;of a violent type&mdash;usually develops within a short time
of the accident&mdash;a few hours or days. Its development is probably
dependent on an <i>acute cerebral &#339;dema</i>&mdash;the result of a most severe
grade of vaso-motor depression&mdash;and it is often, though not
necessarily, associated with extensive cerebral injury. There is
marked engorgement of the cerebral venous system, and considerable
increase of cerebro-spinal fluid, both on the surface of the brain and
in the ventricular spaces.</p>

<p>When insanity develops at a later date, of whatever variety,
it is probably dependent on definite pathological changes. Ll. Powell,
Duret, and others, after investigating the conditions, came to the
conclusion that the injury was comparatively superficial&mdash;subdural
cysts and h&aelig;matomata, pachymeningitis, osteosclerosis, ossification<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
of the dura mater, &amp;c. They also maintain&mdash;an opinion that I also
hold&mdash;that the nervous phenomena are, in most cases, due to reflex
meningeal irritation.</p>

<p>Ll. Powell reports on 67 cases submitted to operation, with the
following <span class="nowrap">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 41 there was mental recovery.</p>

<p><span class="noshow">In </span>12 there was marked mental improvement.</p>

<p><span class="noshow">In </span>&#8199;5 there was slight mental improvement.</p>

<p><span class="noshow">In </span>&#8199;4 there was no change.</p>

<p>Death resulted in 5 cases.</p>

<p>The results obtained by surgical treatment are largely dependent
on the time that has elapsed since the accident. Lapse of time is no
bar to operation, but the sooner this procedure is carried out the
better for the patient.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">I think that it must be accepted that, without
surgical interference, the prognosis is of the most unfavourable type.
These cases, if left to themselves, drift into the public and private
lunatic asylums, there remaining to the end, hopeless wrecks.</p>

<p>If such is the case&mdash;and I think that refutation is impossible&mdash;and
if it be accepted that definite pathological changes are usually
present, then it is obvious that surgical interference offers the only
hope of cure or alleviation. The surgeon must be guided by the
case before him, but, in the absence of hereditary taint, exploration
should be carried out, preferably at the site of the original injury,
and as early as possible before the advent of definite cerebral and
pyramidal degenerations.</p>

<p>The operative details vary according to the necessities of the case.
Thus, in acute mania, acting on the supposition that the development
is dependent on an acute cerebral &#339;dema, the surgeon should carry
out a decompression operation. Personally, I hold the view that
Cushing&#8217;s subtemporal decompression operation (see <a href="#Page121">p. 121</a>) should
be carried out on both sides of the skull, with or without lumbar
puncture.</p>

<p>In the more chronic cases, operative procedures are conducted
over the region injured in the anticipation of discovering depressed
bone, subdural cysts, h&aelig;matomata, &amp;c. The operative details
peculiar to all of these conditions are discussed in other sections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span></p>

<p>With special reference to general paralysis of the insane, Dr. Claye
Shaw holds the opinion that a general increase of intracranial pressure
is commonly present. At his instigation, and on other occasions,
I have carried out decompression operations, but I have not been able
to satisfy myself that the patients have experienced any benefit other
than temporary. There was on each occasion a considerable excess
of cerebro-spinal fluid with surface &#339;dema of the brain, but the
ultimate results were certainly disappointing.</p>

<h3>MENINGEAL CYSTS</h3>

<p>Amongst the pathological conditions responsible for the development
of epilepsy, chronic cephalalgia, &amp;c., meningeal cysts must be
regarded as of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Traumatic meningeal cysts are varied in size, site, and structure.
They may be classified as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="cysts" summary="Cysts">

<td rowspan="3" class="text w13m">1. <i>Cysts within the calvarium.</i></td>

</tr>

</table>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Cysts within the calvarium.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Traumatic cysts within the
calvarium, whatever their situation, may be divided into two definite
<span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Where the cyst possesses fibrinous walls (in which h&aelig;matoidin
cysts may be deposited) and contains a grumous material. These
cysts are usually subdural in position, are dependent on the previous
existence of a h&aelig;matoma, and are known as &#8216;blood-cysts&#8217;.</p>

<p>2. Where the cyst&mdash;often of considerable size&mdash;is lined by a thin,
shiny, membranous wall. The contained fluid is almost colourless,
closely resembling cerebro-spinal fluid, but albuminous and having
no sugar-reducing reaction. The fluid is at high tension, spurting
out when the cyst is punctured. The cyst usually lies in relation
to the arachnoid membrane. Hence the name, &#8216;arachnoid cyst&#8217;.</p>

<p>To account for the development of these &#8216;arachnoid cysts&#8217; two
theories have been advanced. Firstly, that they arise as the ultimate
result of a long-continued circulatory disturbance of the vessels of<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
the membranes or of the cortex, with consequent local cystic accumulation
of cerebro-spinal fluid or serum; and secondly, that shrinking
of the brain occurs in the region of an injury as the result of sclerotic
changes in the cerebral substance, any contraction tending to lead
to the formation of a vacuum which becomes filled with fluid derived
from the surrounding membranes. According to this latter theory,
arachnoid cysts are in reality &#8216;cysts ex vacuo&#8217;.</p>

<p>As regards symptomatology, little need be said. Occasionally
&#8216;arachnoid cysts&#8217; of considerable size have been discovered at post-mortem
examinations which appeared to have exercised no local or
general pressure effects during life. More often the cysts, whether
&#8216;blood-cyst&#8217; or &#8216;arachnoid cyst&#8217;, lead to the development of Jacksonian
epilepsy, chronic headache, and the like, and are discovered
during the exploratory operation carried out for such conditions.
Occasionally they may be shelled out entire, but it is more usual
for the surgeon to remain content with the removal of the parietal
wall (see <a href="#Page195">p. 195</a>). The results obtained by surgical treatment are
sufficiently gratifying.</p>

<h3>TRAUMATIC ORBITAL ANEURYSM<br />
(<i>Pulsating Exophthalmos</i>)</h3>

<p>This condition was first investigated by Rivington in 1875. Since
that date many other cases have been reported, and the following
remarks are based on the examination of the records of 26 cases,
2 of which have come under my own care.</p>

<p>The nature of the trouble, the results obtained by operative
treatment, and the direct evidence supplied by post-mortem examination
furnish sufficient proof to justify the statement that the symptoms
are dependent on the formation of an arterio-venous aneurysm,
the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus intercommunicating
by means of one or more fistulous channels. That such
a lesion may arise from direct violence&mdash;the introduction of some
sharp weapon along the upper and inner portion of the orbital cavity&mdash;-is
readily comprehensible. Such injuries are, however, of rare occurrence,
and the formation of the aneurysmal communication is usually
the result of indirect violence&mdash;the application of severe blows to the
antero-lateral and lateral aspects of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span></p>

<p>In explanation, the following preliminary facts may be <span class="nowrap">accepted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the great majority of cases the blow was applied to the temporal
region, the patient was rendered unconscious, bleeding freely
from the ear, nose, and mouth, and remained under treatment for
some considerable time. From these facts it may be assumed that
the patient suffered from a fracture of the base of the skull&mdash;anterior
or middle fossa, or both foss&aelig;. Evidence has already been brought
forward to show (1) that the majority of fractures involving both
anterior and middle foss&aelig; traverse the body of the sphenoid, and
(2) that the cavernous sinus is very susceptible to injury. It was also
demonstrated that the internal carotid artery is only liable to injury
in that part of its intracranial course where it is embedded in the
outer wall of the cavernous sinus. Two instances of such a lesion
have been described in the section dealing with injuries to intracranial
vessels (see <a href="#Page148">p. 148</a>, and <a href="#Fig53">Figs. 53</a> and <a href="#Fig54">54</a>).</p>

<p>From these facts and from the post-mortem evidence supplied
by the few cases that have come to autopsy, it may, I think, be
concluded (1) that traumatic orbital aneurysm implies a condition
of arterio-venous aneurysm with direct communication between the
internal carotid artery and the cavernous venous sinus, and (2) that
the aneurysmal formation is dependent on a basic fracture which
traverses the region of the body of the sphenoid bone.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the communication between the two vascular
channels may be estimated from the fact that proptosis&mdash;usually the
first symptom to make its appearance&mdash;seldom becomes apparent till
one or two months have elapsed after the accident. It would appear,
therefore, probable, that the artery is not ruptured but merely
weakened at the time of the injury, the weakened arterial wall
gradually giving way before the force of the blood-stream till a definite
communication is formed between the two channels.</p>

<p>The male sex, by reason of its greater liability to severe injuries,
is generally the one involved, especially between the ages of 20 and 30.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline following">1. <i>Proptosis</i></h5>

<p class="hinline nospace">&mdash;usually the first symptom
to develop&mdash;seldom makes its appearance till after the lapse of one to
two months. The eyeball is protruded in the downward and outward
direction, the main pulsating tumour presenting at the upper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
inner quadrant of the orbit. Proptosis is generally steadily progressive,
and, in the most marked cases, the globe may be almost
pushed out of its socket. In any case the &#8216;whites&#8217; of the eye are
unduly prominent.</p>

<h5 class="inline">2. <i>Aneurysmal symptoms.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The tumour pulsates synchronously
with the heart&#8217;s beat, whilst compression of the common carotid of
the same side results in cessation of pulsation and great diminution
in the size of the aneurysmal swelling. On releasing the compression
force the tumour regains its original size in two or three beats of the
heart, and, for a short time, pulsates more forcibly than before.
A definite thrill is imparted to the examining finger, and, on auscultation,
a loud murmur is heard, not only over the tumour itself, but
also widely conducted over the bones of the vault, especially along
the line of the superior longitudinal sinus. The free collateral circulation
between the angular and ophthalmic arteries permits of the
involvement of vessels in the inner orbital and upper nasal regions.
This is well shown in the case depicted in <a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig61">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61. A Case of Traumatic Orbital
Aneurysm.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h5 class="inline">3. <i>Pressure symptoms.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The impairment of venous flow in those
radicles which drain into the cavernous sinus is evidenced by the
marked engorgement of palpebral, conjunctival, episcleral, and retinal
veins. Obstruction to lymph flow is shown by a hazy cornea, chemosis,
and &#339;dema of the parts surrounding the orbit. The danger thus
incurred by the cornea is rendered more serious by the inability on
the part of the patient to close the eyelids over the protruded globe.
Keratitis and sloughing of the globe are to be feared. From muscular
involvement, squints and diplopia are frequently observed. The
pupil may be fully dilated through paralysis of the third nerve.</p>

<h5 class="inline">4. <i>Subjective symptoms.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">Defect in vision is experienced at an
early date, but perhaps the most prominent subjective symptom lies
in &#8216;noises in the head&#8217;, compared by the patient to the thud of
a steam-hammer, the whirring of wheels, the buzzing of bees, &amp;c.
These noises are more or less constant, most annoying to the patient,
and increased on bending down, straining, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All these symptoms tend to become more severe as time lapses,
though cases have been recorded in which the symptoms remained
<i>in statu quo</i>. In the event of failure at relief or cure, the patient runs
considerable risk of losing his sight from corneal ulceration, whilst<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
repeated h&aelig;morrhages and secondary infection may place the patient
in imminent danger of his life.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">In the consideration of the treatment of this condition,
the results obtained in the 26 cases investigated will afford
a valuable guide.</p>

<p>In 4 cases an expectant attitude was adopted, the patient
being kept quiet, restricted in diet, and dosed with potassium
iodide. One case improved, two
experienced no material benefit,
and the fourth, dissatisfied,
discharged himself from the
hospital.</p>

<p>In 10 cases compression
was applied to the common
carotid artery, with the result
that in 3 cases the conditions remained
stationary whilst in the
remainder, either on account of
the pain produced or from complete
failure to bring about
any improvement, this mode of
treatment was abandoned in
favour of ligature of the common
carotid. In some cases
the carotid compression was
carried out by means of tourniquets,
in others intermittent digital pressure was utilized by means of
relays of assistants.</p>

<p>In 18 cases the common carotid was ligatured, in 12 cases as
a primary measure, in 6 after failure of other methods. The immediate
and remote results were in all cases as satisfactory as could be anticipated.
Proptosis at once diminished, the globe receding in some cases
to the normal position, and the distressing subjective symptoms were
almost entirely relieved. In many cases the patients were enabled
to return to work.</p>

<p>Some defect in vision commonly persists, dependent on muscular
paresis (on account of the previous stretching), retinal thrombosis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
or corneal changes. The longer radical treatment was deferred the
greater and more distressing were the after-effects of the lesion.</p>

<p>According to Sattler, however, the results obtained by ligature
of the common carotid are less favourable than as stated above, and
by no means devoid of danger to life. Fifty-six cases were collected
with results as <span class="nowrap">below:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>39 cases recovered and showed marked improvement.</p>

<p>11 cases experienced no benefit.</p>

<p>&#8199;8 cases died.</p>

<p>It has been urged that ligature of the <i>internal</i> carotid artery would
suffice to bring about equally satisfactory results, combined with less
danger to life and diminished risk of secondary cerebral degeneration.
Such, however, does not seem to be the case, for the anastomosis
between the angular arteries and between the terminal branches of
the ophthalmic is so free that the results obtained by ligature of the
internal carotid appear to be unsatisfactory. Indeed, even when the
larger trunk was tied, secondary operations have been occasionally
required in order to excise some large anastomotic channel in the
region of the inner canthus of the eye and over the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>From these data, the following conclusions can be <span class="nowrap">drawn:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That by means of rest, careful dieting, and administration
of potassium iodide in large doses, the progress of the case can sometimes
be arrested, but that much patience is required and the ultimate
result is entirely problematical.</p>

<p>2. That compression&mdash;digital or instrumental, intermittent or
continuous&mdash;is painful, tedious, and usually quite inefficacious.</p>

<p>3. That ligature of the common carotid affords the best chance
of cure or alleviation.</p>

<p>When should the common carotid artery be ligatured? How
soon after the development of symptoms? This depends largely on
the severity of the accident that produced the arterio-venous communication.
If the blow was severe and the depth and duration of the
stage of unconsciousness of a prolonged character, it may be presumed
that the brain was injured. Under such circumstances early ligature
of the common carotid presents an appreciable danger by reason
of the development of hemiplegia on account of the further interference
with the arterial supply to the brain. In such cases the patient<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
should be confined to bed or kept quiet for not less than two months,
the operation being carried out when the general condition warrants
surgical interference.</p>

<p>In the event of early operation being imperative, periodic digital
compression of the common carotid, for a few minutes at a time,
may be carried out with the object of accustoming the brain to the
proposed new form of circulation. In ordinary cases the sooner the
common carotid is tied the better is the ultimate result.</p>

<p>Sch&uuml;ster,<a id="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> from an investigation of 1,000 cases, showed that
cerebellar tumours are relatively more common than cerebral, the
comparative size of the two regions being taken into account. An
examination of Paton&#8217;s table shows that cerebellar and extra-cerebellar
tumours together form rather more than 25 per cent. in
202 cases of brain-tumour formation.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Pathology.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Gliomata, sarcomata, and endotheliomata are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
three commonest types of tumour formation. Other forms are
fibromata, tuberculomata, syphilomata, cysts, and carcinomata.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Gliomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">occur with almost equal frequency in cerebrum and
cerebellum. They are generally primary and single, the boundaries
but ill-defined, and the tumour is seldom amenable to radical surgical
procedures.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Sarcomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">grow from the meninges, periosteum of cranial bones,
and from the sheaths of nerves and vessels. They are either primary
and then single, or secondary and then multiple (sarcomatosis).<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
Sarcomata are often more or less encapsuled, tending in the first
instance to exercise a compression force, and only in the later
stages to invade the surrounding regions. It is during this early
stage of development that the tumour is capable of removal.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66. An Acoustic Tumour.</span> Attached loosely to the seventh and

</div>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Endotheliomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">grow from the meninges of the brain. They
are hard, nodular, and, in their early stages, definitely non-infiltrating,
and, when accessible, removable.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Fibromata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">are especially prone to originate in the cerebello-pontine
angle, usually possessing a narrow stalk representing an
atrophied nerve-trunk or vascular bundle. From the frequency with
which these cerebello-pontine tumours are attached to the eighth
nerve they are often designated <i>acoustic</i> tumours. They may be as
small as a pea or as large as a hen&#8217;s egg. In their early stages they are
probably pure fibromata, appearing as pink-red lobulated tumours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
They are of slow growth, primarily compressing the brain-substance
without invasion. Later on degenerative changes are prone to occur,
with invasion of the cerebellar substance and extension into the internal
auditory canal. Whether growing in the cerebello-pontine angle
or in other parts of the skull, fibromata are often readily removed.</p>

</div>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Tuberculomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">are most commonly situated beneath the
tentorium. They are often multiple. They cannot be considered as
favourable tumours from the surgical point of view, insomuch as
they are frequently associated with tuberculous lesions in other parts
of the body and complicated by a tuberculous infiltration of the
meninges.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Syphilomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">occur with greater frequency in the cerebrum than
in the cerebellum. Sometimes they are totally unaffected by anti-syphilitic
remedies, and, under such conditions, appear as densely hard
and definitely encapsuled tumours. These more chronic gummata
are usually cortical or subcortical in position, and, when accessible,
are readily removable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Cysts</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">are of frequent occurrence. They may be (1) of traumatic
origin, containing a grumous material characteristic of the incompletely
absorbed blood-clot; (2) of parasitic origin (e. g. echinococcus);
(3) due to cystic degeneration of a sarcomatous, carcinomatous,
or gummatous mass; or (4) simple arachnoid cysts (see <a href="#Page203">p. 203</a>).
Many of these cysts are amenable to surgical treatment.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Carcinomata</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">are always secondary to cancer in other parts of
the body&mdash;more especially carcinoma mamm&aelig;. They are usually
multiple, and quite unsuited to surgical procedures.</p>

<p>Any of these tumours may be complicated by the presence of
internal hydrocephalus, this condition being dependent on the pressure
exercised by the tumour on the veins of Galen, or on the interference
with the normal transudation of fluid from one ventricle to another.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The symptoms resulting from tumour
formation may be considered under two <span class="nowrap">headings:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>General symptoms</i>, dependent on the general increase of intracranial
pressure.</p>

<p>2. <i>Localizing symptoms</i>, dependent on local compression.</p>

<p>Previous to discussing the symptomatology of brain tumours, it
cannot be too forcibly urged that the surgeon is seldom justified in
embarking on an extensive operation for tumour removal except after
consultation with a neurologist. Ill-planned and ill-timed operations
are usually disastrous in their results, and little creditable to cranio-cerebral
surgery in general. On general grounds also, the symptomatology
of brain tumours, as given below, must be accepted in the
light in which it is offered, not representing the complete neurological
aspect of the case, but affording an index to general diagnosis. For
further information the reader is referred to more extensive works
on brain tumours.<a id="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<h5>I. <span class="smcap">General Pressure Symptoms</span></h5>

<p>Headache.</p>

<p>Mental disturbances.</p>

<p>Optic neuritis, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Vomiting.</p>

<p>Alterations in pulse, respiration, and blood-pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>Alterations in temperature.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Headache.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Headache is an almost constant symptom, and
presumably dependent on general or local dural tension. It may be
general or localized, intermittent or continuous, intense or comparatively
mild in character. It is the more intense when the tumour
develops in the confined space of the subtentorium, and when the
tumour is of considerable size. In young subjects, before the skull
is synostosed, some compensatory enlargement of the skull may
postpone the development of headache, or diminish its intensity.</p>

<p>The diagnostic value of a localized headache is rather problematical,
but, when constantly referred to some particular region
and when associated with definite tenderness on percussion, the
localization of the headache assumes considerable importance in the
regional determination of the tumour. Still, too much stress must
not be placed on the site of the pain. A cerebellar tumour may give
rise to frontal headache, and vice versa.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Mental disturbances.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">In the earlier stages of tumour development
the patient is irritable, depressed, or apathetic, shows his
objection to his fellow mortals on all possible occasions, is unable to
concentrate his attention or exhibits impairment of memory. As has
rather quaintly been observed, he appears in every sense to &#8216;have
a weight on his mind.&#8217; Inquiry amongst relatives will show that he
has &#8216;changed in every way&#8217;, or &#8216;is not the same man&#8217;.</p>

<p>Mental changes vary according to the site and size of the tumour.
For example, it has been stated that a general air of elation or exhilaration
(Witzelsucht) may be regarded as almost diagnostic of tumours
situated in the anterior part of the frontal lobe.</p>

<p>As the tumour increases in size, somnolence becomes the marked
feature, progressing on to stupor and coma. In rare cases, mania
may develop.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Optic neuritis.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Optic neuritis must be regarded as one of the
most constant and valuable symptoms in the diagnosis of intracranial
tumour formation. The degree to which it progresses
depends more on the site of the tumour than on its size. In general,
it may be stated that it is most constantly associated with tumours
of the temporo-sphenoidal and cerebellar regions, less common in<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
frontal tumour formation, still less frequent in post-central tumours,
and perhaps least common in tumours of the pons. In this last-mentioned
case optic neuritis is always late in development,
and not infrequently absent throughout the whole stage of the
illness.</p>

<p>Primary optic atrophy only occurs when the tumour exerts
direct compression on the optic chiasma and tracts&mdash;for example,
pituitary tumours.</p>

<p>Paton,<a id="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
from a series of 252 cases treated at the National Hospital,
of which 202 were accurately diagnosed, found that optic neuritis or
atrophy was present in 81&middot;2 per cent. cases. The fundus change,
though usually bilateral, may be confined to the ipso- or contra-lateral
side. Considerable discussion has taken place as to the localizing
value of unilateral disk changes. For instance, it has been stated
that a unilateral neuritis indicates that the tumour is situated on
that side of the brain, and that when disk changes are bilateral the
side which evidences the higher grade of inflammation is the side on
which operation should be conducted. In the light, however, of the
most recent research it would appear that unilateral symptoms are
not to be relied on in establishing the localization of the tumour.
Gowers<a id="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> lays stress on the statement that with strictly unilateral
neuritis one should always suspect a general rather than a local
exciting cause.</p>

<p>The actual cause of the neuritis is still a matter of doubt. It
is possible that the same cause is not present in every case. Still,
sufficient evidence is to hand to justify the probability that neuritis is
dependent on the general increase of intracranial pressure&mdash;there is, at
any rate, a close relationship between the two. The cerebro-spinal
fluid is forced into and dammed up within the vaginal sheaths of
the optic nerve, leading, in the first instance, to an &#339;dema, and
later on, to compression of the lamina cribrosa and interference with
the circulation.</p>

<p>The increase of intraventricular pressure may also act directly
on the optic tracts and chiasma&mdash;the anterior boundaries of the third
ventricle&mdash;the pressure being then transferred directly to the nerve
tracts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, the great intensity, great frequency of occurrence,
and rapid development of optic neuritis when the tumour is subtentorial
in position may be explained on the hypothesis that the
rigid enclosure of the cerebellum permits of the ready application
of pressure to the veins of Galen or to the iter, thus leading to an
increase of intraventricular pressure, this pressure being then transferred
to the optic region.</p>

<p>The alternative theory states that the old tissue destruction and
the new tissue formation sets free certain toxic substances which act
on the optic nerve-fibres, leading to &#339;dema and inflammation.
Paton, however, comes to the conclusion that &#8216;the nature of the
tumour does not play any part in determining the onset of neuritis
except in so far as the nature determines its localization&#8217;.</p>

<p>Whatever be the localizing value of optic neuritis, it is generally
accepted that it commences in the upper nasal quadrant.</p>

<p>Visual acuity is but little impaired in the earlier stages of optic
neuritis, but so soon as atrophic changes develop, diminution in the
field of vision occurs.</p>

<p>The pupillary changes associated with tumours of the brain are
closely connected with these fundus changes. In the early stages,
the pupils may be contracted with the object of protecting the inflamed
surfaces exposed to light, whilst, when atrophy develops, the pupils
may steadily dilate, becoming fully dilated and fixed as the atrophic
changes become fully developed.</p>

<p>These pupil changes must therefore be taken into consideration
in estimating the value of pupillary changes in general.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Vomiting.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Vomiting is dependent on stimulation of the
medullary vomiting centre, or on irritation of the dura mater in the
immediate neighbourhood of the tumour. The dura is supplied by
branches of the fifth cranial nerve, the stimulus being referred to
the vagus centre in the floor of the fourth ventricle.</p>

<p>Vomiting is of the so-called &#8216;cerebral&#8217; type. It is of frequent
occurrence, generally irrespective of ingestion of food and seldom
preceded by any nausea and retching. The attacks are often associated
with exacerbation of headache, and more rarely with some
slight elevation of temperature. The more severe the vomiting the
more likely is the tumour to be subtentorial in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span></p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Alterations in pulse, respiration, and blood-pressure.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">In
the early stages there is but little alteration in pulse and respiration.
Later on, the increasing intracranial pressure acts as a stimulus on
the vagus and vaso-motor centres, the pulse becomes slowed and the
blood-pressure raised. When the pressure is considerable, the slow
pulse and deep, even stertorous, respiration evidence the effect produced
on the medullary centres. In the terminal stages the imminent
exhaustion of these centres is heralded by progressive acceleration
of the pulse, by great fall in blood-pressure, and by the advent of
Cheyne-Stokes respiration.</p>

<p>The more marked the alterations in pulse and respiration the
more likely is the tumour to be subtentorial in position.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Alterations in temperature.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The temperature tends to
remain subnormal throughout the progress of the case, except during
the terminal stages when pyrexia is often observed. Occasional
elevations of temperature during the course of the illness may be
explained by transient attacks of ependymitis or cerebritis.</p>

<p>Differences of temperature on the two sides of the body may
occasionally be observed, especially when the tumour involves the
basal ganglia.</p>

<h5>II. <span class="smcap">Localizing Symptoms</span></h5>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>A</i>) <b>To the non-excito-motor frontal region (anterior frontal).</b></h6>

<p class="hinline"><i>Headache</i> tends to be localized to the frontal region, <i>vomiting</i> is
seldom a conspicuous feature, and <i>optic neuritis</i> is not only rather
later in development, but also less progressive than when the tumour
is placed in other situations. If the tumour occupies the orbital
aspect of the lobe, primary optic atrophy (from pressure) may be
existent on the affected side with optic neuritis of the contralateral
fundus.</p>

<p>The <i>mental condition</i> is often profoundly altered and, according
to some writers, more especially so when the tumour is situated on
the left side. The quality of mental change varies considerably in
individual cases. In some there is an attitude of general suspicion,
the patient following all points in his general examination with a
curious air of suspicion, in others moral perversion is the rule, whilst
in a third group of cases a state of elation and exhilaration is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
predominant feature, a condition which, as previously stated, is said
to be pathognomonic of a tumour frontally situated.</p>

<p><i>Anosmia</i>&mdash;uni- or bi-lateral&mdash;may be present, but, on account of
the general condition of the patient, considerable difficulty is experienced
in endeavouring to demonstrate the existence of this symptom.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig68">
<img src="images/illo220.png" alt="" width="600" height="515" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68. The Cortical Motor and Sensory Areas.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Incontinence of urine</i> has been observed, independent of the
condition of the patient&mdash;in other words, without a sufficient degree
of coma to account for the state.</p>

<p>When the tumour is of considerable size, some degree of <i>paresis</i>
of the contralateral side of the body may result, due to backward
pressure exercised by the tumour on the corona radiata preceding
from the pre-Rolandic motor area. Associated with this paresis the
deep <i>reflexes</i> may be increased with extensor plantar reflex (Babinski)
and some diminution of superficial reflexes. The more posterior the<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
tumour the greater the degree of paresis, and the more exaggerated
the reflexes. When the tumour is situated on the left side the <i>motor
speech</i> centre may be affected.</p>

<p><i>Fine tremors</i> may be noticed, usually involving the muscles of the
upper extremities, and best demonstrated by asking the patient to
hold his arms horizontally with the palms downwards.</p>

<p>Paresis on the contralateral side may be preceded by or associated
with <i>fits</i>, these partaking of the Jacksonian type and accompanied
by conjugate deviation of the eyes towards the side opposite
to that on which the tumour is situated. This association of fits
suggests that the tumour occupies the second frontal convolution.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>B</i>) <b>To the excito-motor frontal region.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">In the early
stages symptoms of irritation predominate, the patient suffering from
<i>fits</i> of a focal or Jacksonian type (see <a href="#Page189">p. 189</a>), whilst, later on, <i>paresis</i>
of a progressive type, involving the face or extremities unequally,
becomes evident. In children, however, the rapid transference of
impulses from one motor area to another causes the fits to soon lose
their focal character, <i>general convulsions</i> taking their place.</p>

<p>If the tumour occupies the left side of the brain (in right-handed
individuals) the <i>motor speech</i> centre of Broca may be involved, with
difficulty in or failure of the power of speech.</p>

<p><i>Apraxia</i> may be present, a condition characterized by inability
on the part of the patient to perform certain familiar purposive movements,
such as sewing, turning a key in the lock, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The contralateral <i>pupil</i> may be contracted from irritation, or
dilated from paralysis; the ipsolateral is variable, more commonly
dilated.</p>

<p>In the event of extensive tumour formation and when the growth
is associated with tract degeneration, the deep <i>reflexes</i> will be increased
on the contralateral side, with well-marked extensor plantar response.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>C</i>) <b>To the post-central, angular, and marginal convolutions.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Attacks of focal <i>epilepsy</i> are frequently observed when the
tumour occupies the post-central convolution, such developments
being probably dependent on forward pressure effects. These
epileptiform attacks, however, are almost invariably preceded by
some <i>sensory aur&aelig;</i>. Furthermore, the fits will usually be followed
by &#8216;some degree of an&aelig;sthesia or analgesia, a loss of tactile sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
over half the body, affecting mostly the hand and foot, with loss of
power and astereognosis (inability to recognize the form and consistency,
and to name objects placed in the affected hand)&#8217; (Beevor).</p>

<p>When situated in the left angular gyrus, <i>word-blindness</i> may
result&mdash;inability to appreciate the meaning of written words, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the tumour presses on the optic radiation, <i>hemianopia</i>
results, with ipsolateral temporal and contralateral nasal blindness.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>D</i>) <b>To the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">When the tumour
occupies the anterior part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, more
especially when it is situated on the internal aspect of that lobe, the
degree of <i>optic neuritis</i> is intense. Perversion or loss of <i>smell</i> may be
noticed&mdash;a symptom of difficult determination on account of the
general condition of the patient.</p>

<p>As the result of pressure exercised on the optic tracts <i>hemianopia</i>&mdash;with
hemianopic pupillary reaction (the pupil not reacting to
light)&mdash;may be observed. Pupillary reactions, however, are complicated
by possible paralysis of the third nerve.</p>

<p>Some <i>weakness of the face muscles</i> on the contralateral side is
a fairly constant symptom, presumably dependent on the upward
pressure exercised on the lower motor areas.</p>

<p>A tumour involving the more posterior and central portions of
the lobe may bring about a certain degree of <i>word-deafness</i>, whilst
objects may be incorrectly named or named with difficulty, the patient
being more or less aware of his mistakes and evidencing considerable
annoyance of the same.</p>

<p>In whatever part of the lobe the tumour be situated, certain
sensory aur&aelig; may be present. Not infrequently the patient falls
into the so-called &#8216;dream-state&#8217;. When sensory aur&aelig; are associated
with crude sensations of smell and taste, with chewing or spitting
movements, the tumour is probably situated on the antero-internal
aspect of the lobe.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>E</i>) <b>To the occipital lobe.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline"><i>Headache</i> may be localized to the
back of the head, and <i>optic neuritis</i> is usually both early in onset
and intense in degree. Perhaps the most important localizing symptom
is <i>homonymous hemianopia</i>&mdash;blindness in the temporal half of
the retina on the same side as the lesion and in the nasal half of the
opposite eye. This is explained by the fact that the fibres of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
optic radiation, passing forwards from the affected occipital region,
supply those retinal areas. The reaction of the pupil will be unaltered,
for the pupillary nerve-fibres, in
their course towards the third
nerve nucleus, are only directed
backwards as far as the anterior
corpora quadrigemina. Consequently,
an interruption of optic
fibres between retina and third
nerve nucleus brings about a loss
of pupillary reflex when light is
thrown on the blind portion of
the retina, whilst if the lesion be
situated further back, pupillary
reaction is unaltered. This is
Wernicke&#8217;s sign.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>F</i>) <b>To the subtentorial
region.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Certain symptoms are
more or less common to all subtentorial
tumours, whether they
arise within the cerebellar substance
(intra-cerebellar) or immediately
outside the brain-substance
(extra-cerebellar). <i>Headache</i>
is very severe, and in about
50 per cent. cases, localized to
the back of the head, perhaps
associated with stiffness of the
neck muscles and retraction of
the head. <i>Optic neuritis</i> is early
in onset and intense in degree.
It is more constant in cerebellar
tumour formation than in tumours located in almost any other part
of the brain. The choking of the disk is marked and h&aelig;morrhages
are frequent. <i>Vomiting</i> and other symptoms referable to increased
subtentorial pressure&mdash;slow pulse, altered rhythm of respiration, &amp;c.&mdash;are
usually well marked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span></p>

<p><i>Vertigo</i> is most apparent when the patient is suddenly changed
in position or tries to stand or walk. It appears in two forms, either
as a definite sense of movement of self (subjective vertigo) or of
objects (objective vertigo), or merely as a giddy feeling. In objective
vertigo the sense of displacement of objects is more commonly from
the side of the tumour towards the sound side.</p>

<p>Vertigo is dependent on the influences exercised by the tumour
on the cerebello-vestibular apparatus, and on irritation of those
branches of the fifth nerve which are distributed to the dura mater
in the immediate neighbourhood of the tumour, the impulses being
then transferred to the bulbar nuclei of that nerve and thence to the
pneumogastric nucleus.</p>

<p><i>Ataxia and inco-ordination of movement</i> are also prominent
symptoms. Ataxia results from one or more of the following causes:
(1) co-existent vertigo, (2) asthenia of the muscles of the affected side,
the muscular contractions being irregular in their nature, ill-timed
in their action, and often in excess of actual requirements, and (3)
involvement of the spino-cerebellar tracts and their terminations.</p>

<p>The patient, when standing with the eyes shut and one foot
advanced in front of the other, is unable to maintain his balance,
staggers and tends to fall. No great diagnostic value can be attached
to the direction in which he sways or falls, though, from my own
experience, it would appear more probable that he should lurch
towards that side on which the tumour is situated. In walking,
however, there is occasionally a definite tendency to deviate towards
the opposite side, probably due to over-correction of the weakened
muscles on the affected side. The gait should present the typical
appearance of cerebellar ataxia, and the patient may walk with the
head drawn down towards the shoulder of the affected side, the chin
being tilted in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Inco-ordination of movement is rendered most obvious during
active movement of the limb, decreasing towards the termination of
that movement, and ceasing so soon as the object is attained. This
is most readily demonstrated by the well-known &#8216;finger-to-nose&#8217; test.</p>

<p><i>Nystagmus</i> is one of the most frequent symptoms of cerebellar
tumour, usually lateral, the movements coarse or fine, and most
marked when the eyes are directed towards the side of the lesion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span></p>

<p>In the more differential diagnosis between <i>extra- and intra-cerebellar</i>
tumours, the following points should be <span class="nowrap">noted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Extra-cerebellar</i> tumours situated in the cerebello-pontine angle
tend to lead to compression of the eighth nerve (with deafness and
tinnitus), of the seventh nerve (with paralysis of the face muscles),
of the fifth nerve (with an&aelig;sthesia of the parts supplied by that nerve),
and more rarely of the sixth nerve (with paralysis of the external
rectus). The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth nerves are but rarely
involved.</p>

<p><i>Intra-cerebellar</i> tumours seldom give rise to pressure effects on
isolated cranial nerves. On the other hand, one expects ipso-lateral
paresis or paralysis, with exaggerated reflexes (see <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>). Conjugate
deviation of the eyes to the side opposite to that on which
the tumour is placed is a fairly frequent symptom, the deviation being
associated with well-marked lateral nystagmus. When the tumour
is of considerable size, or placed nearer the central portion of the
cerebellum, pressure may be exerted on the pyramidal fibres with
paresis or paralysis on the contra-lateral side of the body.</p>

<p>In addition, allusion should be made to Dana&#8217;s symptom&mdash;&#8216;cerebellar
fits&#8217;&mdash;said to be almost pathognomonic of an extra-cerebellar
tumour (or abscess) situated in the cerebello-pontine angle.
In such cases, there may be sudden attacks of tinnitus, vertigo, and
apparent loss of consciousness, during which the patient falls to the
ground as if struck with lightning. The final stage of falling is said
to be dependent, not so much on actual loss of consciousness, as from
the absence of cerebellar innervation and a total loss of equilibrium.
These attacks are brought about by sudden alterations in position.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>G</i>) <b>To the pituitary region.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Considerable research has
recently been carried out, and much knowledge obtained as to the
functions of the pituitary body and the symptoms that result from
lesions of the gland.<a id="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> As is well known, the pituitary body consists
of two portions, an anterior (derived from upgrowth of buccal
epiblast) and a posterior (formed from neural epiblastic downgrowth).</p>

<p>Complete removal of the body in animals invariably terminates
fatally, the patient exhibiting a definite train of symptoms&mdash;cachexia
hypophyseopriva&mdash;and dying within a few days or weeks, the younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span>
animals living longer than the older. The symptoms of apituitarism
are as follows: fall of body temperature, lowering of blood-pressure,
increasing feebleness, muscular tremors, a curious attitude resembling
that of def&aelig;cation, coma, and death.</p>

<p>On further investigation it was proved that all these symptoms
were observed when the anterior portion of the gland was alone
removed, whilst, on the other hand, extirpation of the posterior half
created no great change in the animal&#8217;s general health.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig70">
<img src="images/illo226.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70. A Pituitary Tumour.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the human being it would appear that the symptoms resulting
from the development of pituitary tumour formation may be classified
into two groups, those of hyper-pituitarism and those of hypo-pituitarism.</p>

<p>In the former case the secretion being superabundant, acromegaly
and giantism are observed. Keith<a id="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> considers that one of the
substances secreted by the gland is of the nature of a hormone,
rendering the osteoblasts hypersensitive to the various stresses that
fall upon the human skeleton during life, and that the osteoblasts,
at the origins and insertions of muscles, become increasingly sensitive
to the traction of muscles. Muscular impressions and processes of the
skeleton become exaggerated by the new bony matter, and if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
epiphyseal lines be still open, the osteoblasts of which appear to be
specially affected, giantism is produced. The skull and skeleton of
the giant O&#8217;Brien are regarded as typical examples of the results
due to over-secretion of the gland.</p>

<p>Hypo-pituitarism leads to a striking and rapid development of
fat (adiposity), loss of sexual power and amenorrh&#339;a, persistence of
sexual infantilism (if the patient be attacked when young), harsh
skin and &#339;dematous tissues, subnormal temperature, and psychic
disturbances.</p>

<p>In any case, whether the secretion of the gland be increased or
decreased, the developing tumour tends to compress those cranial
nerves with which it is in close anatomical relation. For instance,
the gland, being situated immediately behind the optic chiasma,
tends to compress the mesial nasal optic fibres producing bilateral
temporal hemianopia, with primary optic atrophy as a final result.
In some cases optic neuritis is observed with secondary atrophy.
The third, fourth, and sixth nerves may also be affected, with consequent
squints, ptosis, and perhaps complete ophthalmoplegia.</p>

<p>In addition, it should be noted that glycosuria and albuminuria
have been observed.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">In the <i>general diagnosis</i> of brain tumours, reference must be
made to <i>Lumbar puncture</i> and <i>X-ray investigation</i>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Lumbar puncture.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">With respect to the desirability of carrying
out lumbar puncture in brain tumours and the value of the information
obtained, considerable difference of opinion exists. Lumbar
puncture supplies information as to the tension of cerebro-spinal
fluid and as to its bacteriological and cytological character. The
evidence so obtained as to tension is of little value in view of the
proved increase of intracranial pressure as evidenced by the mental
condition of the patient, the headache, optic neuritis, &amp;c. On the
other hand, bacteriological and cytological examination of the fluid
may point to the tuberculous or syphilitic composition of the tumour,
thus offering help from the point of view of treatment. Still, information
of almost equal importance can be obtained by tuberculin,
Wassermann, and other tests. There is also considerable risk attendant
on the process. The rapid withdrawal of cerebro-spinal fluid has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
followed by disastrous results, the medullary stem being suddenly
forced downwards into the foramen magnum, with corking up of
that aperture, and complete upset of the medullary centres. Such
a disaster is the more likely to occur when the tumour is subtentorial
in position. Looking at the question from the broadest point of view,
it would appear that the performance of lumbar puncture in cases of
suspected brain tumour is fraught with considerable peril.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>X-ray examination.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">X-ray examination should always be
carried out. More commonly the results are negative, the nature
of the tumour seldom permitting sufficient shadow formation. Occasionally
the firmer and denser tumours allow of a more definite result.
When the tumour arises from the bone, or is so situated as to change
the shape of the part with which it is in contact, valuable information
will be obtained. For example, the hollowing out and general
enlargement of the sella turcica in pituitary tumour formation.</p>

<h4 class="left"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Indications for operation.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The indications for operation must be
considered under two <span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Those for radical operation aiming at the removal of the tumour.</p>

<p>Those for palliative operation aiming at the alleviation of
symptoms.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>For the radical operation.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">According to Risien Russell,<a id="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the
following are the main <span class="nowrap">indications:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Cases in which the tumour can be accurately diagnosed.</p>

<p>(2) Cases in which the tumour is situated in an accessible
position. The more favourable sites are the surface of the cerebrum,
the lateral lobe of the cerebellum, and the cerebello-pontine angle.</p>

<p>(3) Cases in which there is reason to believe that the tumour is
simple, and of such a nature that it can be removed from its bed.</p>

<p>(4) Cases in which there is reason to believe that the removal of
the tumour will not greatly imperil the patient&#8217;s life, and, furthermore,
will not result secondarily in the development of fits, paralysis,
aphasia, &amp;c.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>For the palliative operation.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The following are the main indications
for <span class="nowrap">operation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>To prolong life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span></p>

<p>To alleviate the severe and persistent headache.</p>

<p>To stop fits.</p>

<p>To save the sight.</p>

<p>And, in general, to benefit the patient by reducing the increased
intracranial pressure, <i>even though it may be quite impossible to remove
or even locate the tumour</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the considerations enumerated above, for which palliative
measures are indicated, there is no symptom which more urgently
demands alleviation than optic neuritis. This question of sight-saving
may be accepted as a basis on which to estimate the value
of palliative measures in general. It is obvious that no mere &#8216;decompression&#8217;
operation will save the sight when the optic inflammation
has progressed to atrophy, and even in the earlier conditions of
neuritis cases must be carefully chosen. Herbert Bruce<a id="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> admirably
clinches the matter in the following words: &#8216;As to the prediction
of improvement of vision after trephining, everything depends on the
condition of the disks. Yellowish white patches of exudate or white
atrophic changes, especially when associated with macular changes,
all indicate that the secondary changes in the disks will be permanent.
In proportion to this development will the vision be impaired, whilst
when the loss of vision has been dependent on the swelling of the
disks, then not only will the sight be saved but largely improved.
In other words, one might say, therefore, that when the neuritis has
not progressed on to atrophy the sight would be saved.&#8217; Even in the
event, however, of the ocular conditions being unfavourable for
palliative operation, other factors in the case still remain&mdash;the
terrible and persistent headache, the fits, the emaciation from vomiting,
&amp;c., all of which require the most careful consideration, and all
of which can be remedied by an efficient decompression operation.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Radical operation for cerebral tumours.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">After the usual
preparatory treatment and the application of the scalp-tourniquet,
the skull is opened either by craniectomy or craniotomy. The two
methods&mdash;with their relative advantages and disadvantages&mdash;have
already been described (see <a href="#Page10">Chapter II</a>), but there can be no question
that a brain tumour should be exposed by the formation of an osteoplastic
flap. Such a procedure is called for on the ground that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
exact localization of the tumour is always a matter of very great
difficulty, and that it is impossible to foretell with certainty as to
whether it will be feasible to remove the tumour or not.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>A bone-flap is framed suited to the occasion, and permitting
adequate exposure of the dura. The question then arises as to whether
the dura should be incised, the brain explored, and an attempt made
at the removal of the tumour, or whether these procedures should
be postponed till the patient shall have recovered from any shock
attendant on the first stage. The two-stage operation&mdash;first advocated
by Horsley&mdash;is insisted on by some surgeons. By others it is
maintained that it is preferable to complete the operation at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
sitting, mainly on the ground that two an&aelig;sthetics and two operations
are more dangerous than one. As to which course should be adopted
is entirely dependent on the general condition of the patient at the
termination of the bone-flap formation. If his condition is quite
satisfactory, if there has been but little h&aelig;morrhage, and if the blood-pressure
shows no tendency to drop, then it is perfectly justifiable
to &#8216;carry on&#8217;, opening the dura mater and searching for the tumour.
Still, as the shock entailed during the first stage may be considerable,
as the surgeon cannot possibly foresee with certainty what lies
beneath the dura mater, and as considerable time must elapse, and
some h&aelig;morrhage result during the further procedures required for
the reflection of the dura mater and removal of the tumour, it follows
that it is generally advisable to conduct the operation in two stages,
the second operation being carried out some days later. Not less than
five to seven days should elapse between stage one and stage two,
the scalp-flap is then but lightly healed, whilst all blood-vessels
should be sealed. The patient also will have entirely recovered from
any shock attendant on the first stage.</p>

<p>At the second stage, the dura may be more or less covered with
a film of coagulated blood, meningeal arteries and the outline of
venous sinuses being correspondingly obscured. Consequently, if the
dural flap proposed for the second operation should include these
structures, the meningeal vessels may be ligatured and the sinuses
mapped out with guide-threads at the completion of the first stage.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Examination of the dura mater.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Considerable help may be
obtained by examination of the dura mater, both with regard to the
localization of the tumour and investigation as to its nature. Pulsation
may be abolished or diminished, whilst the tenseness of the
membrane is increased in direct proportion to the size and site of the
tumour. The membrane also may be &#339;dematous or adherent, an&aelig;mic
in colour from pressure exercised by an underlying tumour, reddened
from vascularization, grey-brown from the immediate presence of
a malignant mass, plum-coloured from the adjacency of a subdural
h&aelig;morrhage, opaque from the presence of an arachnoid cyst.</p>

<p>Some evidence as to the nature of the tumour may be obtained
by palpation&mdash;fluctuation suggesting cyst formation, solidity pointing
to more definite formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span></p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Opening the dura mater.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The membrane can be opened either
by crucial incision or by flap formation. The latter method is to be
preferred. All meningeal vessels that cross the line proposed for
dural section must be underrun on either side of that line. The dural
incision should always fall short of the margins of the gap in the skull
by at least <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, in order to allow of accurate approximation at the
termination of the operation.</p>

<p>The following points with respect to the opening of the dura
mater, though already enumerated in <a href="#Page10">Chapter II</a>, should be noted.
The membrane is lightly incised with the scalpel, and, so soon as the
pia-arachnoid is exposed, the section completed with the blunt-pointed
scissors, or on a grooved director. The dural flap is then
turned down and the brain laid bare. It is most essential that every
precaution should be taken to avoid injury to superficial cerebral
veins&mdash;the cortex is probably under high tension, firmly compressed
against the dura mater and bulging out forcibly so soon as tension
is relieved.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Examination of the brain.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">In the event of the exposure of the
tumour, its removal can at once be attempted. If, however, the
tumour be subcortical in position, its position and boundaries may
be estimated by electrical stimulation, palpation and exploration.</p>

<p><i>Electrical stimulation</i> will evidence whether the area exposed
corresponds to the symptoms evinced by the patient. With respect
to the actual technique, one pole is placed on the patient&#8217;s extremity&mdash;it
matters not which, though preferably on the homo-lateral side&mdash;the
other over the exposed brain. The current should be just strong
enough to contract exposed muscle&mdash;some of the fibres of the temporal
muscle are generally available for the purpose. If there is much
pia-arachnoid &#339;dema, some of the fluid should be evacuated&mdash;by
gentle scratching of the membranes&mdash;and the bare brain stimulated.
In the event of complete degeneration of the pyramidal tracts there
is little or no response to such stimulation. Under other circumstances
the results are quite definite.</p>

<p><i>Palpation</i> may reveal the nature of the tumour, whether fluid
or solid.</p>

<p><i>Exploration of the brain</i> should only be undertaken in the light
of a reasonably certain diagnosis, and every precaution must be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
to avoid needless damage to the cerebral substance. The exploration
should invariably be preceded by incision with the brain-knife or
scalpel, introduced in such a manner as to avoid injury to all visible
vessels and directed at right angles to the surface of the brain, so as
to cause the least possible damage to the corona radiata, &amp;c.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Extirpation of the tumour.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The proportion of brain tumours
surgically removable is small, and even when the tumour is fully
exposed considerable experience is required in estimating the possibility
of removal.</p>

<p>When the tumour is circumscribed, whether meningeal, cortical,
or subcortical, it may be shelled out of its bed with greater or lesser
ease according to its nature and position. This shelling out process
is carried out with an ordinary tea-spoon or scoop. H&aelig;morrhage
may be severe though generally readily controlled by lightly packing
with dry gauze. More rarely one or more of the superficial vessels
will require to be underrun with a small needle threaded with the
finest catgut. Muscle grafts (see <a href="#Page18">p. 18</a>) may be of considerable
assistance.</p>

<p>If a cyst be found it may be possible to shell it out entire, failing
which the parietal wall is freely dissected away, and the cavity drained
for two or three days.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig72">

<img src="images/illo235.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="454" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72. Combined Flap Formation and Decompression.</span> After osteoplastic
resection, the tumour has been found irremovable. The dura mater is therefore
sewn back in position, after which a portion of the bone is nibbled away from the bone-flap&mdash;as
depicted in the illustration&mdash;and the underlying dura mater freely incised.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>If the tumour be extensive and ill-defined in margin, no attempt
should be made at removal, the surgeon remaining content with the
second desideratum of brain tumours in general&mdash;the production
of a general decrease of intracranial pressure. This might be readily
effected by leaving the dura open and by removing at the same time
the osseous portion of the osteoplastic flap. The bone is readily
dissected away and free decompression would be permitted. In
such cases, however, the hernial protrusion is usually excessive, and
insomuch as an osteoplastic flap is more often than not framed over
the Rolandic region, the protrusion would include the motor area
with disastrous results on the contra-lateral extremities. This course,
therefore, should never be adopted. In such cases it is infinitely
preferable to follow Cushing&#8217;s method of combined exploration and
decompression. This is done as follows: &#8216;From under the portion
of temporal muscle which has been turned back with the flap, a roughly
semicircular area of bone is cut away with heavy rongeurs, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
remove bone without jar, and so without risk of stripping the
remainder of the resected bone from the soft parts. This accomplished,
a similar area is rongeured away from the side of the skull
well down the temporal fossa under the tourniquet, the temporal
muscle being held away by a retractor. If the base of the bone has
been made sufficiently broad, a margin possibly a centimetre in width
can be left on each side as a support for the flap after its replacement.
A subtemporal bone defect is thus secured with even less difficulty
than is experienced in making the usual subtemporal opening from
without through a split muscle incision. The dura is then carefully
opened and incised in a stellate fashion to the margin of what promises<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
to be a sufficient circle of denuded cortex for a generous decompression.&#8217;</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Closure of the dura and reposition of the flap.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Whether the tumour
has been exposed and removed, is deemed irremovable, or has not been
found, the dural flap should be approximated and carefully sutured
in position. In many cases, however, this dural approximation is
exceedingly difficult to accomplish, by reason of the outward bulging
of the diseased or &#339;dematous brain. This difficulty may be overcome
by adopting one or more of the following <span class="nowrap">methods:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Elevation of the head</i>, thus reducing the amount of blood in the
brain.</p>

<p><i>Lumbar puncture</i>, a method that presents some danger when the
surgeon has to deal with a subtentorial tumour, but which bears in its
train excellent results from the point of view of reduction of intracranial
pressure. The danger arises from the fact that the sudden
escape of cerebro-spinal fluid may cause the brain-stem to be engaged
in the foramen magnum, with disastrous results on the medullary
centres.</p>

<p><i>Ventricular puncture</i>, when the ventricles are dilated. A blunt-pointed
aspirating needle is introduced into the lateral ventricle
through the most prominent portion of the exposed brain, and a
sufficient quantity of cerebro-spinal fluid evacuated.</p>

<p><i>&#8216;Milking&#8217; the pia-arachnoid</i>, the pia-arachnoid being pricked
with a needle in several places and the contained fluid squeezed out.</p>

<p><i>Subtemporal decompression</i>&mdash;the final resource. When all other
measures fail, a subtemporal decompression may be conducted on
the opposite side of the brain.</p>

<p>The dura should be accurately sutured with numerous interrupted
silk sutures. It is very important that every precaution
should be taken to prevent the continued escape of cerebro-spinal
fluid, and, for this and other obvious reasons, it is necessary to avoid
drainage whenever possible. If such a course should be necessary&mdash;by
reason of h&aelig;morrhage&mdash;a cigarette drain may be brought out
at the most dependent and convenient angle of the dural flap, and
through one of the trephine holes or gap purposely cut in the
bone-flap.</p>

<p>In any case, the bone-flap is replaced, resting on its shelf and<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
anchored by means of numerous deep sutures, each of which picks
up the aponeurosis or muscle both along the upper border of the flap
and the two downward vertical prolongations. These sutures will
also control bleeding from the divided scalp-vessels. The tourniquet
is removed, dressings applied, and the whole maintained firmly in
position by a gauze bandage applied circumferentially. These
dressings are supported by bandages and the patient sent back
to bed.</p>

<p>If the tumour has been exposed by <i>craniectomy</i>, the gap in
the skull will probably require protection. This procedure (see
<a href="#Page182">Chapter VI</a>) can be carried out at the termination of the main
operation or at a later date. This latter course is to be preferred.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Radical operation for cerebellar tumours.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Craniectomy
may be regarded as the operation of choice in the exposure and
removal of cerebellar tumours. The formation of an osteoplastic
flap is contra-indicated (see <a href="#Page29">p. 29</a>). The operative procedures vary
according as to whether it is desired to expose the one or both
cerebellar hemispheres. Bilateral exposure, though presenting the
great advantage of offering a larger field for exploration, is by far
the more serious of the two operations.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Unilateral cerebellar exposure.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The patient being placed in the
semi-prone or face-down position, the incision starts at the posterior
border of the apex of the mastoid process, curves inwards along the
superior curved line of the occipital bone to the occipital protuberance,
and then passes straight down the middle line of the neck for 2 to 3
inches. If the incision is deepened at once to the bone, h&aelig;morrhage
is severe. The incision should first involve the skin and then the
muscles attached to the occipital bone. Each vessel as encountered
is clipped and tied. The flap must be turned down right up to the
posterior margin of the foramen magnum.</p>

<p>The flap being held aside, the pin of the trephine is placed in such
a manner that the disk to be removed will correspond to the thin
central portion of the cerebellar fossa. The trephine, placed low
down, is directed more or less towards the anterior fontanelle.</p>

<p>The disk being removed, the bone is freely cut away with
rongeur forceps&mdash;outwards to the posterior border of the mastoid
process, upwards to the curved line, inwards to near the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
line, and downwards to the posterior margin of the foramen
magnum.</p>

<p>This generally completes the first stage of the operation, for, in
cerebellar tumours, it is usually advisable to complete the operation
in two stages. The scalp-flap is replaced, lightly sewn into position,
and the patient sent back to bed.</p>

<p>A few days later the flap is again turned down, the dura incised,
and turned down as a flap the convexity of which corresponds to
but falls short of the line of the lateral sinus. The cerebellar substance
is then examined and the tumour removed after the lines enumerated
in dealing with cerebral tumours. Greater difficulty, however, is
experienced in the attempted removal of cerebellar tumours, for the
operator is working in a very confined space, and because the cerebellum
tends to herniate through the adventitious hole in dura and bone.
Two other factors must be taken into consideration: (1) the danger
incident to all cerebellar operations of respiratory
failure,<a id="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and (2) the
friability of the cerebellar substance. Every care must be taken to
avoid unnecessary damage of the brain-matter.</p>

<p>When the tumour is situated in the cerebello-pontine angle,
a somewhat favourite site for tumour formation, &#8216;lateral displacement&#8217;
of the cerebellum towards the middle line will aid considerably
in the exposure. A flat retractor, bent to a suitable curve, is introduced
between the dura and the cerebellum, and the brain-matter
gently but firmly retracted towards the middle line. As the brain
yields to the pressure the tip of the retractor is insinuated towards
the posterior surface of the petrous bone. With the aid of a head-lamp
a good view may usually be obtained of the region involved, and, as
the tumour is but lightly attached, its removal can be undertaken.</p>

<p>The dura is then carefully sutured and the scalp-flap accurately
replaced, deep sutures for the muscles and a few surface sutures for
the skin. Drainage should be avoided whenever possible&mdash;the discharge
of cerebro-spinal fluid is fraught with considerable danger.
The gap in the skull requires no other protection than that afforded
by the mass of neck muscles.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h6 class="inline"><i>Bilateral cerebellar exposure.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">This operation is also done in
two stages. In the first, each cerebellar fossa is exposed in turn,
the scalp-flap being framed and the trephining and cutting away
of the bone carried out in the manner previously described for
unilateral exposure. The osseous bridge which separates the two
openings in the skull is divided above and below with Gigli&#8217;s saw,
and the intermediate part removed. This completes stage one.</p>

<p>In the second stage, again carried out a few days later, two dural
flaps are turned down, each similar to the one described in unilateral
exposure. This leaves a central portion of dura, that part which
encloses the occipital sinus and to which the falx cerebelli is attached.
By means of an aneurysm needle, threaded with catgut, passed
through or around the falx, the occipital sinus is ligatured above and
below, the ligatures being applied as high and as low as circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
permit. The falx is then divided between the two ligatures and the
two flaps thrown upwards and downwards respectively.</p>

<p>The extra space so afforded not only allows of the exposure of
both hemispheres, but also permits of the further dislocation of the
one lobe towards the opposite side, thus facilitating the examination
of the lateral aspect of the cerebellum and of the cerebello-pontine
angle.</p>

<p>This bilateral method is a serious operation. H&aelig;morrhage may
be severe, and the attendant risks of respiratory failure are not
inconsiderable. It should only be adopted (1) when a tumour is so
situated or so extensive that more space is required than supplied
by unilateral exposure, and (2) when bilateral cerebello-pontine
tumours are suspected.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Palliative operations for cerebral and cerebellar tumours.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">A primary palliative operation may be conducted over the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
of the tumour itself, in the cerebellar region, or over the temporal
lobe&mdash;one of the so-called &#8216;silent&#8217; areas of the brain.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the greatest degree of pressure relief will be
obtained by craniectomy conducted over the region of the tumour
itself. To this course, however, there are two great objections:
(1) the exposed cortex most commonly includes the motor area,
herniation of which will lead to disastrous effects on the extremities
of the contra-lateral side&mdash;spasticity, paralysis, aphasia, &amp;c.; and
(2) the herniation of brain-matter including, or closely related to, an
irremovable tumour tends to lead to &#339;dema of the brain tissues and
softening of and h&aelig;morrhage into the growth, with subsequent rapid
development of the outwardly protruded mass.</p>

<p>With respect to cerebellar decompression operations, I must
confess that I have formed a most unfavourable opinion. The subtentorial
pressure can undoubtedly be relieved most effectually by
such methods, but the immediate results are not infrequently disastrous,
the patient dying within a few days as a result of the complete
upset of medullary centres.</p>

<p>In the event of the surgeon deciding to confine his attempts to
palliative treatment&mdash;alleviation of symptoms only&mdash;the <i>subtemporal
operation</i> of Cushing is certainly the method of choice. The technique
of the operation and its general advantages have already been discussed.
It merely remains to add that, when the operation is conducted
for tumour relief and not for injury as discussed in <a href="#Page68">Chapter IV</a>,
no attempt is made to explore the temporo-sphenoidal lobe and
drainage is contra-indicated. The dura, widely incised, is left open,
the temporal muscle and fascia accurately sutured, and the scalp-flap
secured with fine silk sutures.</p>

<p>With regard to the side on which this subtemporal decompression
operation is to be conducted, the best results are obtained by operating
on that side on which the tumour is situated. In the event of doubt,
the right side is chosen, so avoiding any possibility of including, in
the hernial protrusion, the motor speech area of Broca. The cranial
defect should be made as large as possible, and in the event of failure
in bringing about adequate decompression, a similar operation is
conducted at a later date on the opposite side of the skull.</p>

<p>After subtemporal decompression there should be no mortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span></p>

<p>The immediate results are eminently satisfactory&mdash;headache is
relieved, optic neuritis steadily diminishes, vomiting ceases, and the
general condition of the patient is immensely improved.</p>

<p>The expectancy of life after such decompression operations
requires careful consideration. So much depends on the nature of the
tumour that it is difficult to make more than a general observation.
In many cases life has been prolonged for one to two years, whilst
instances are recorded in which the patient has lived for five to six
years&mdash;not in a miserable condition as might be imagined, but in
comparative comfort.</p>

<p>It might be added that, as the tumour grows, a one-sided subtemporal
decompression may gradually become insufficient. In such
cases, recrudescence of symptoms&mdash;redevelopment of optic neuritis,
&amp;c.&mdash;may be met by further decompression on the opposite side of
the head.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Operations for tumours of the pituitary body.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The
pituitary body may be approached by the frontal, temporal, and
nasal routes. The <i>temporal route</i>, advocated by Caton and
Paul<a id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and
Horsley, possesses the disadvantage that the surgeon, whilst utilizing
an approach similar to that used in the Hartley-Krause operation
for trigeminal neuralgia, encounters on his way the structures laterally
situated to the pituitary body, the internal carotid, the cavernous
sinus, the third, fourth, and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic division
of the fifth. The anatomical difficulties are therefore considerable.
Added to this, the tumour, in its hollowing out of the central portion
of the sella turcica, may leave such lateral osseous walls that an
approach from the side is impossible.</p>

<p>The <i>frontal route</i> is strongly advocated by
Krause.<a id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He states that,
&#8216;an osteoplastic flap is framed in the frontal region, immediately
to one side of the middle line, so as to avoid the superior longitudinal
sinus and frontal air sinus, and turned upwards. It is essential that
the operator should approach the tumour along the floor of the anterior
fossa, and, for this purpose, it may be deemed necessary to chip away
the bone in the region of the supra-orbital ridge. Some days later,
the final stages of the operation are conducted. The dura mater<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
covering the frontal lobe is stripped away from the bone and traction
applied to the dura by means of broad flat spatul&aelig;. When the lesser
wing of the sphenoid is exposed, the dura mater is opened in the
vertical direction on a line with the lower median angle of the wound
at a depth of 5 to 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> centimetres, as measured from the anterior surface
of the frontal bone. If the incision is made at a deeper point there is
danger of injury to the optic nerve, which is covered with dura mater
in this situation. Laterally the dura is opened parallel to the posterior
border of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cm. in front of it,
to avoid the sinus which lies immediately in contact with the edge
of the bone. This exposes the optic nerve, coming from the chiasma
and the internal carotid. The pituitary body is located beneath the
anterior edge of the chiasma. The diaphragm of the sella turcica
is now carefully incised with a small hook-shaped scalpel, and the
hypophysis is readily removed.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <i>nasal route</i>, advocated by Bruns and successfully carried out
by Schloffer<a id="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and Cushing, seems to offer the greatest advantages
and give the most successful results. The general details of the
operation are as follows: starting either beneath the upper lip
or externally at the base of the septum, the mucous membrane is
peeled away from each side of the vomer, and, by gradual piecemeal
removal of that bone, the advance is carried out towards the base
of the skull in what may be called an intra-mucous space. By the
introduction of suitable instruments into this space the cavity is
gradually enlarged, at the expense of the turbinated bones which
are compressed by the dilating instruments. By this means&mdash;gradual
removal of the septum&mdash;the operator approaches the base of the skull,
always working between the two layers of mucous membrane, and
always avoiding, with the greatest care, any laceration of the same.
Laceration at once converts the more or less aseptic operation into an
infected one. When the base of the skull is laid bare in the region
of the sphenoidal sinus, the bone is there chiselled away and the under
surface of the pituitary body exposed. It can then be removed
piecemeal.</p>

<p>The general details of the operation as enumerated above may
require amendment as our knowledge increases. Sufficient has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
said, however, to point out the various methods of approach and the
advantages claimed for the nasal route.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Results of operation on brain tumours.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Statistics are
always fallacious, and this is especially the case with regard to
operations on tumours of the brain. Few surgeons have operated
on a sufficient number of cases to compile satisfactory statistical
tables. These tables are generally made up from the combined
experience of many operators, all using their own methods. The
following, however, will serve to give an approximate idea as to
mortality, &amp;c.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Mortality.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">From earlier records the immediate mortality was
estimated at 30-40 per cent. Duret, however, records 400 cases with
a mortality of 19&middot;5 per cent., 58 cases dying from shock, 10 from
hyperpyrexia, and 10 from h&aelig;morrhage. In my own practice, the
mortality may be estimated at a much lower figure. Perhaps I may
be too conservative, but I hold the view that, unless the tumour is
readily exposed and equally readily removable, it is inadvisable to
carry out further measures for its eradication. Moreover, the general
technique of brain surgery has advanced with rapid strides, and the
question of early and accurate localization has received equal attention.
The mortality has diminished proportionately, and may be
estimated at less than 20 per cent. So much depends on the surgeon
and on the nature of the tumour, its position and localization, that it
is impossible to make any absolute statement as to the risk to life
attendant on operation. If all tumours were fibromata, cortically
situated, and accurately diagnosed, the operation, in the hands of a
skilled neurological surgeon, should present but a very low mortality.
So long, however, as surgeons will persist in burrowing into the brain
substance for a supposed subcortical tumour, so long will the mortality
remain high. The great secret in operating on a brain tumour lies
in knowing when to terminate the attempt at removal of the tumour
and when to rest content with a pure &#8216;decompression&#8217;.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that cortical tumours&mdash;more especially
such as give rise to early localizing symptoms, e.g. Rolandic tumours&mdash;offer
a better prognosis than when the surgeon has to deal with
subcortical, central, and basal tumour formation.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>The mortality according to the region affected.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The following table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>

<p>Sir Victor Horsley draws attention to this question in the following
manner: &#8216;If a line be drawn from the frontal eminences to the
occipital protuberance, it is obvious that more shock results from
operations below that line than from above, and as we proceed from
the frontal to the cerebellar pole of the encephalon.&#8217;</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>The mortality according as to whether the tumour is found or not.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">According to Horsley, of 79 cases in which a correct diagnosis was made
and the tumour removed, 7 died from shock; whilst in 16 cases inaccurately
diagnosed, 6 died&mdash;a mortality of 9 per cent. in the first case
as against 37 per cent. in the second.</p>

<p>The added danger resulting from unsuccessful attempts at finding
the tumour must not be advanced as an argument against the palliative
operations, for the failure to find and remove the tumour
implies diligent search for the neoplasm, with necessary prolongation
of operative procedures, and perhaps extensive manipulation of the
brain substance. Statistics and experience both afford conclusive
evidence that accurate localization is essential for the success of the
operation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="chapname">THE INFECTIVE DISEASES OF THE BRAIN AND MENINGES: ABSCESS
OF THE BRAIN, MENINGITIS, LATERAL AND CAVERNOUS SINUS
THROMBOSIS, HERNIA CEREBRI</span></h2>

<h3>ABSCESS OF THE BRAIN</h3>

<p>Abscess of the brain may be considered under the following
<span class="nowrap">headings:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Multiple abscess.</p>

<p>Acute traumatic abscess.</p>

<p>Chronic abscess.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Multiple abscess.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Multiple abscess results from the lodgement
of infected emboli which, derived from an acute infective osteomyelitis,
endocarditis, gangrene of the lung, &amp;c., are carried by the blood-stream
to the brain. Multiple abscess of the brain may therefore be considered
as part of a general infection. On account of the symptoms dependent
on the primary infection and on the secondary py&aelig;mic developments,
a diagnosis can seldom be determined, and, even in those rather
hypothetical cases in which suspicion may be aroused, surgical
interference is quite useless and the prognosis hopeless. It is, therefore,
quite unnecessary to discuss the matter further.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Acute traumatic abscess.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Acute traumatic abscess of the
brain most commonly arises in connexion with an infected compound
fracture of the skull. In the event of laceration of the dura mater,
infective organisms have a ready means of access both to the meninges
and to the brain itself, meningitis or cerebritis resulting. This
liability to meningeal and brain infection is increased when hair,
portions of clothing, bullets, or other foreign bodies are embedded
amongst the comminuted fragments of bone, or driven into the brain
substance. In the event of the dura mater remaining intact, meningitis
or cerebritis may still develop if, as the result of scalp suppuration,
the diploic vessels become thrombosed and plugged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
bacteria, some of which may be carried inwards by the reversed
blood-stream, and perhaps by lymphatic connexions.</p>

<p>The infection may remain localized to the adjacent brain substance,
an acute traumatic cerebral abscess resulting, or may become
more widely diffused&mdash;diffuse cerebritis&mdash;a condition usually associated
with general meningeal infection.</p>

<p>An acute traumatic cerebral abscess is almost necessarily situated
immediately beneath the site of osseous and membranous lesion,
being, in fact, more a meningo-cortical abscess than a brain abscess
proper. The boundaries are but ill-defined, the walls ragged, and the
contents of a brown-red colour. The surrounding brain is in a condition
of red softening, that is to say, extensively infiltrated with
leucocytes, the vessels thrombosed and teeming with bacteria, whilst
minute extravasations of blood lead to the characteristic colour both
of the contents of the abscess and of the surrounding tissue.</p>

<p>In the more chronic cases, the surrounding area shows some
attempt at repair, dense armies of leucocytes barring the way to the
spread of the infection, and, in the more favourable cases, allowing
of the formation of a definite fibrous barrier.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The symptoms resulting from an acute
traumatic cerebral abscess are largely dependent on the site of the
abscess. In the earlier stages of development suspicion may be
aroused by the presence of persistent headache&mdash;frequently localized
to the region primarily affected&mdash;by mental and bodily irritability,
restlessness, and pyrexia. All these symptoms may, however, be
produced by the unhealthy condition of the scalp-wound&mdash;free
suppuration, bare bone, and extra-dural suppuration.</p>

<p>On or about the third day, the condition of the patient becomes
more grave, the change for the worse being usually of rapid development,
and preceded by severe rigors and general convulsions. The
patient shows further signs of mental irritation, being delirious,
restless, and occasionally actually maniacal.</p>

<p>The temperature is high and rigors are frequent. The pulse is
small and rapid, the respiration increased in frequency, irregular, and
often partaking of the Cheyne-Stokes type. The face is livid, the
skin hot and burning. Vaso-motor disturbance is evidenced by profuse
sweating and well-marked <i>tache c&eacute;r&eacute;brale</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Prognosis and treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The prognosis is almost hopeless
unless radical measures are adopted in the early stages. The scalp-wound
should be enlarged and comminuted fragments of bone
removed, or the skull trephined over the region of the suspected
abscess. The lacerated dura mater is freely opened up and the surface
of the brain exposed. Purulent material is gently removed, and the
wound closed in such a manner as to allow of free drainage.</p>

<p>Even under the most favourable local conditions the prognosis
is bad.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Chronic abscess.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">As a preliminary statement it must be
pointed out that breaking down new growths, softening gummata,
caseating tuberculous masses, actinomycotic and hydatid cysts, are
regarded in the light of tumour formation and are discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of 52 cases of brain abscess admitted of recent years into
St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital, 41 partook of the chronic type, 30 being
dependent on otitic disease, 3 on frontal sinus suppuration, 5 resulting
from lung disease, and 2 of uncertain origin. The 11 acute cases were
either traumatic or py&aelig;mic.</p>

<p>From these and other statistics it may be regarded as generally
accepted that the majority of brain abscesses are secondary to chronic
disease of neighbouring bone, and more especially middle ear disease.
This being the case, it might naturally be inferred&mdash;on anatomical
grounds&mdash;that the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum and the
cerebellum are more liable to infection than any other part of the
brain. From 100 cases treated at my hospital the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe and cerebellum were involved in the proportion of about 2 to 1.

<p>Hunter Tod,<a id="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> reporting on 100 cases treated at the London
Hospital, found that in children under 10 years of age temporo-sphenoidal
abscess occurred in 87 per cent. cases, and cerebellar in
13 per cent., whereas in adults cerebral abscess occurred in 65 per cent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
and cerebellar in 35 per cent. The development of temporo-sphenoidal
and cerebellar abscesses in the same case was observed in 5 per cent.
cases.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Pathology.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Insomuch as chronic middle ear disease forms the
main predisposing factor in the development of abscess of the brain,
the pathology of brain abscess in general may be considered by
discussing the main features peculiar to otitic abscess in particular.</p>

<p>As the result of chronic middle ear disease, the mucous lining
of the middle ear and its accessory cavities becomes destroyed, the
antrum filled with cholesteatomata, and the middle and external ears
with granulations. The discharge of pus, previously free, is obstructed,
partial or complete blockage occurring. The destruction of the
mucous lining allows of invasion of the surrounding bone, the veins
become thrombosed and filled with bacteria, and the cancellous
spaces blocked with granulations. Further erosion of the bone
results, both in the upward direction towards the tegmen tympani
and in the backward towards the lateral sinus groove and cerebellum.
The veins of the tegmen communicate freely with those of the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe, whilst those ramifying in the mastoid region either
communicate with the lateral sinus itself or with the anterior cerebellar
venous system. Infection may therefore spread (1) <i>upwards</i>
to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, or (2) <i>backwards</i> to the lateral sinus
and cerebellum. In the former case, meningitis or temporo-sphenoidal
abscess develops: in the latter instance, meningitis, lateral sinus
thrombosis, or cerebellar abscess.</p>

<p>For the formation of a brain abscess it is, of course, essential
that the brain membranes overlying the main site of osseous erosion
should be sealed off in such a manner as to prevent a general infection
of the meningeal region, the dura becoming adherent to the eroded
tegmen, &amp;c. It is &#339;dematous and throws out granulations, both on
its parietal and visceral aspects. The parietal granulations aid in the
further erosion of the bone, whilst the visceral may, according to
Macewen,<a id="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> even indent the brain. By means of thrombosed veins,
perivascular lymphatics, and minute arterioles, a channel of infection
is now opened up between the site of osseous erosion and the temporo-sphenoidal
and cerebellar lobes.</p>

<p>In any case the abscess usually develops in the white substance
of the brain, just beneath the grey matter, and in close relation to the
primary source of infection.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>The wall of the abscess.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">In an abscess of rapid development the
walls are ragged and but ill-defined from the surrounding brain
substance. In the more chronic cases the cavity is shut off from the
brain by a capsule of varying density&mdash;usually not more than one-sixteenth
of an inch in thickness, but occasionally of much greater
development (see <a href="#Fig86">Fig. 86<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a>). Sometimes&mdash;more especially in cerebellar
cases&mdash;two cavities may be superimposed, the two abscesses communicating
with one another by means of a narrow, and often
tortuous, channel. Successful drainage of the one cavity may be
inadequate to drain its companion. This two-saced abscess will be
again alluded to at a later period.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Contents of the abscess.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The pus is usually of a greenish hue,
odourless, and acid in reaction. Though often sterile the following
bacteria may be cultivated&mdash;<i>staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i> and
<i>albus</i>, <i>pneumococcus</i>, <i>bacillus pyocyaneus</i>, and the <i>streptococcus
pyogenes</i>. The pus is usually of such viscidity that it cannot be
evacuated through the lumen of an ordinary aspirating needle.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>The size of the abscess.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">In size the abscess varies greatly, seldom,
however, containing more than 5 or 6 drachms of pus.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>The neck of the abscess.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">It was first pointed out by Ballance<a id="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
that most brain abscesses secondary to disease of the bones of the
skull are &#8216;mushroom-shaped&#8217;, the narrow portion or stem being
attached to the dura mater at the original site of infection. The
stalked form of abscess is &#8216;quite comparable, as to its mode of formation,
to the superficial cervical abscess connected by a narrow track
to a focus of disease beneath the deep fascia&#8217;.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Course pursued by an untreated brain abscess.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The abscess
enlarges at the expense of the surrounding tissues, either bursting
into the ventricles of the brain or coming to the surface, there
rupturing and leading to a diffuse meningeal infection. Some few
cases have been reported in which the abscess has established
a more or less efficient natural means of drainage, either along
the &#8216;stalk&#8217; of the abscess or by means of a new channel to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
exterior. In one or two cases, spontaneous recovery has apparently
taken place.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><i>Mode of healing after successful operation.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">Previous to successful
evacuation, the brain immediately surrounding the abscess cavity
is compressed and an&aelig;mic. As soon as drainage is supplied, it
swells out like a sponge, more or less obliterating the cavity. The
closure of a cavity by means of the formation of granulation tissue
probably never occurs, and, if the falling together of the surrounding
brain is insufficient to obliterate the cavity, final closure is completed
by the in-dragging of the overlying tissues&mdash;scalp, membranes, and
brain becoming intimately fused together.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>The <span class="smcap lowercase">INITIAL</span> stage.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">If a patient suffering from brain abscess
is capable of answering questions, it will usually be found that he
dates his illness from some particular day when he was sick, experienced
a shivering attack, or suffered from a severe attack of headache.
Further inquiry, however, will almost always elucidate the fact that,
for some days or weeks previously, he was not feeling well, suffering
from insomnia and loss of appetite, and experiencing occasional
attacks of headache. Friends and relatives may volunteer information
as to general irritability, alteration of manner, incapability of mental
concentration, and worry over family and financial matters.</p>

<p>At this stage the headache is commonly referred to the frontal
region, less frequently localized to the region of the brain involved.
The patient sleeps badly, and there is often a slight rise of temperature
towards the evening. Occasionally he may vomit, independently
of the ingestion of food.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>The <span class="smcap lowercase">LATENT</span> stage.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Mental depression becomes more marked,
headache is more persistent and now shows a definite tendency to
localization, food is distasteful, and bodily wasting becomes evident.
The evening rise of temperature becomes more constant, sickness
more frequent, and vertigo and giddiness may be noticeable features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span></p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>The <span class="smcap lowercase">MANIFEST</span> stage.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The symptoms arising during the manifest
stage must be considered as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Symptoms dependent on the general increase in the intracranial
pressure.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Symptoms dependent on the localization of the abscess.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms pointing to a general increase of intracranial pressure</i></p>

<p><b>General mental condition.</b> In the latent and early manifest
stages the patient will answer questions more or less correctly, but
with hesitation&mdash;as if from delayed comprehension and from prolongation
of the latent period. Answers are often inappropriate to
the question, and given with some confusion of mind and thought&mdash;the
state of &#8216;slow-cerebration&#8217;.</p>

<p>The patient either lies listless and apathetic&mdash;mentally dulled&mdash;or
exhibits general irritability, lying curled up in bed, intolerant of
all interrogation and examination. More rarely, cerebral irritation
progresses to actual mania, the patient tossing about in bed, muttering
and delirious. Forcible restraint is often required. In the later
manifest stages the patient lies comatose.</p>

<p><b>Headache.</b> Headache is an almost constant feature, varying
greatly in intensity, but often so severe that the patient is incapacitated
from all attempts at conversation and movement. Exacerbations
are frequent, the sufferer crying out in his agony. The pain
may be localized or diffuse. Localization of the pain to some special
region is of considerable aid to the regional diagnosis of the abscess&mdash;more
especially so when it is accentuated by palpation and percussion
over the suspected region.</p>

<p><b>Vomiting.</b> Vomiting is another frequent symptom, probably
dependent on stimulation of the medullary vomiting centre. It is
of the so-called &#8216;cerebral&#8217; type, bearing no relation to the ingestion
of food and unaccompanied by previous nausea and retching. The
vomited material is propelled outwards with considerable force.
There appears to be some relation between the exacerbations of headache
and the time at which vomiting occurs. Vomiting is most
constantly observed when the abscess is subtentorial in position.</p>

<p><b>Optic neuritis.</b> It is exceedingly difficult to determine the
frequency with which optic neuritis develops in cases of brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
abscess. Much depends on the site of the abscess and the duration
of its existence. Optic neuritis is seldom absent in the more chronic
cases and is most constant when the purulent collection is subtentorial
in position. The non-appearance of optic neuritis&mdash;even in
chronic cases&mdash;does not confute a diagnosis of abscess formation.</p>

<p>When once present, the swelling of the disk may increase rapidly.
In a case of cerebellar abscess recently under my care the swelling
reached 6D. in three days. Whatever the localizing value of unilateral
neuritis in tumour formation (see <a href="#Page216">p. 216</a>), I am strongly of opinion that
in the cases under discussion, optic neuritis, when confined to or more
marked on the one side, implies that the abscess is situated on that side.</p>

<p><b>The pulse and temperature.</b> It is commonly stated that,
in typical cases of brain abscess, the pulse-rate is slowed&mdash;40 to
60 per minute&mdash;and that the temperature is subnormal. Slowing
of the pulse results from stimulation of the medullary centre, the
lowering of temperature to less determinate causes. In the consideration
of pulse and temperature&mdash;and the two must invariably
be considered together&mdash;it will, however, frequently be found that the
temperature is raised and the pulse-rate but little altered. Thus,
in one case the pulse was 88 and the temperature 103&middot;4 degrees, in
another the pulse was 74 and the temperature 102, in a third case
the pulse was 89 and the temperature 102&middot;8 degrees. These cases
are very significant, and show that the greatest attention should be
paid to a comparison between pulse-rate and temperature, a <i>relative</i>
slowing of the pulse being more constant than an actual retardation.</p>

<p>The elevation of temperature results from the fact that the great
majority of cases of brain abscess are secondary to some highly
infective purulent collection, as, for instance, a mastoid empyema.
In such a case, if the mastoid region be cleared out, the temperature
will fall and the typical clinical picture of subnormal temperature
and slowed pulse-rate will be depicted.</p>

<p><b>The respiration.</b> The increase of intracranial pressure may
lead to some slowing and deepening of respiration. Irregularity is,
however, the more common condition, deepening, in the later stages,
to definite Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Under an&aelig;sthesia&mdash;more
especially in cerebellar cases&mdash;there is considerable risk of respiratory
failure (see <a href="#Footnote48">foot-note</a>, <a href="#Page238">p. 238</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span></p>

<p><b>Vaso-motor changes.</b> Vaso-motor changes are fairly constant,
evidenced by sweats and flushings, <i>tache c&eacute;r&eacute;brale</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Reflexes.</b> In the earlier stages of the trouble the reflexes may
be increased and Babinski&#8217;s sign present. In the later stages, all
reflexes are abolished.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75. A Large Right-sided Temporo-sphenoidal Abscess.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><b>Other more general symptoms.</b> Obstinate constipation, foul
tongue and breath, anorexia, deficient urine, loss of bladder and rectal
control, are all noticeable features. A well-marked leucocytosis is
generally to be observed.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms dependent on the localization of the abscess</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Temporo-sphenoidal abscess.</b> The abscess occupies one
of the so-called &#8216;silent&#8217; areas of the brain, an area merely exercising
a word-hearing faculty (see <a href="#Page163">p. 163</a>). Insomuch, however, as auditory
power is already impaired or lost from the disease existent in the
middle ear, it follows that a temporo-sphenoidal abscess may not give
rise to any localizing symptoms whatever. Definite motor symptoms
will only be observed when an abscess of considerable size exercises an
upward pressure on the lower motor areas, or an inward pressure on
the internal capsule. Thus, (1) when the pressure effects are exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
in the <i>upward</i> direction the lower motor areas will suffer with resultant
paresis or paralysis of the muscles of the contra-lateral face and upper
extremity, and, if the abscess be situated on the left side, aphasia may
also be present. And (2) when the pressure is exerted mainly in the
<i>inward</i> direction so as to interfere with the internal capsule the motor
areas are affected in the reverse order, lower extremity first and face last.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550" id="Fig76">

<img src="images/illo257.png" alt="" width="550" height="587" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76. To illustrate the Pressure Effects of a Temporo-sphenoidal
Abscess</span>:&mdash;(1) <i>upward</i> pressure on the lower cortical motor area, and (2) <i>inward</i>
pressure on the internal capsule. <span class="smcap lowercase">T.S.</span>, Temporo-sphenoidal abscess; <i>a.</i>, Cortical

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span></p>

<p><i>Aphasia</i> will partake of the motor or sensory type according to
the situation of the abscess. Thus, motor aphasia indicates pressure
on Broca&#8217;s area, sensory points to the involvement of the region of
the angular gyrus (see <a href="#Page163">p. 163</a>). According to Schmiegelow, some type
of aphasia was present in 23 out of 54 cases of otitic temporo-sphenoidal
abscess.</p>

<p><i>Facial paralysis</i>, whether due to inward or upward pressure, is
of the incomplete or cortical type, the upper face-muscles escaping
or being but slightly affected. No difficulty need be experienced in
differentiating between the ipso-lateral paralysis which results from
destruction of the facial nerve in the aqueductus Fallopii and the
contra-lateral palsy dependent on the cortical lesion.</p>

<p>Pressure may also be exercised on the post-Rolandic sensory
areas and on the tracts that evolve therefrom, but the general
condition of the patient seldom allows of any accurate diagnosis
with respect to sensory involvement in general.</p>

<p>When the abscess is of considerable size, both <i>third</i> and <i>sixth</i>
nerves may be involved. For instance, the third nerve, emerging
from the brain at the anterior border of the pons, and passing along
the inner border of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, is liable to irritation
or pressure paralysis. In the former case, the pupil on the affected
side will be contracted, in the latter instance dilated. When
<i>ipso-lateral</i> third nerve paralysis coexists with paralysis of the
opposite face and upper extremity, a condition of crossed paralysis
results.</p>

<p>When the sixth nerve is involved the external rectus on the side
of the lesion is paralyzed with resultant internal squint. Conjugate
deviation of the eyes towards the side opposite to the lesion and
secondary lateral nystagmus have both been observed.</p>

<p>Further assistance in the localization may be obtained by careful
observation as to the position of the headache, by palpation and
percussion of the skull, and by a comparison of the intensity of optic
neuritis in the two disks.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Cerebellar abscess.</b> Many of the symptoms previously
described when dealing with brain abscess in general are intensified
when the focus of suppuration is situated in the confined space
beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Thus, headache is exceptionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
severe and more or less localized to the occipital and cerebellar
regions. Again, optic neuritis may develop rapidly and reach a high
grade of intensity, vomiting is early in onset and of frequent occurrence,
whilst certain other symptoms dependent on the increased
intracranial pressure&mdash;slowing of the pulse, alterations in respiratory
rhythm&mdash;are correspondingly accentuated.</p>

<p>The more typical <i>localizing</i> symptoms are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Vertigo</i> is a prominent symptom, most evident on sudden
alteration of position on the part of the patient. He complains, for
instance, of great giddiness on sitting up in bed. The sensation of
movement may be of self or of objects.</p>

<p>When standing, he tends, when unsupported, to fall or lurch in
some particular direction, more commonly, in my experience, towards
that side on which the abscess is situated. On this point, however,
there is some difference of opinion and, by itself, it cannot be accepted
as having any great localizing value.</p>

<p>In some rare cases Dana&#8217;s symptom may be noticed&mdash;a sudden
unexpected attack of vertigo, roaring in the head, relaxation of limbs,
and falling to the ground in an unconscious state. This symptom
is said to be almost pathognomonic of an abscess (or tumour) situated
in the region of the cerebello-pontine angle.</p>

<p>The <i>cerebellar gait</i> can of course only be demonstrated when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
patient is in a fit condition to walk. He shows, by the position of the
feet, a desire to obtain a wide base of support and staggers on, in his
desire to carry out his instructions, usually inclining towards the side
on which the lesion is situated. This inclination is probably dependent
on the weakness of the muscles of the ipso-lateral side (see <a href="#Ref03">below</a>).
Another important feature may be observed in the tendency on the
part of the patient to turn the head in such a way that he faces
somewhat in the opposite direction, the chin being directed towards
the opposite shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Disturbances of co-ordination</i> may be demonstrated by telling the
patient to touch the tip of his nose with his finger, or to strike at an
object held a foot or two in front of him. Such attempts are characterized
by uncertainty and irregularity of movement, accompanied
by considerable tremor.</p>

<p id="Ref03"><i>Paresis or paralysis of the limbs on the ipso-lateral side.</i> The
abscess usually occupies the antero-external aspect of the lateral lobe
of the cerebellum, and is so situated that no direct pressure is exercised
on the pyramidal fibres. Some weakness&mdash;perhaps paralysis&mdash;of
the muscles of the extremities on the same side as the lesion can,
however, usually be demonstrated. According to Luciani, this is
explained in the following manner:&mdash;between the cortex of the one
side and the cerebellum of the other there are certain &#8216;associated&#8217;
fibres, the strength of the impulses sent out from the cortex depending
in part on the integrity of these reinforcing cerebellar fibres. In cases
of cerebellar abscess these reinforcements are cut off with consequent
paresis, or even paralysis, of the muscles of the face, arm, and leg on
the same side as the lesion. Associated with this muscular weakness
there is usually some increase in the deep reflexes. Some of the
pyramidal fibres do not decussate, and, consequently, an ipso-lateral
paralysis may be associated with a contra-lateral paresis.</p>

<p>The same lessening of cortical impulses accounts for a weakening
in the external rectus of the same side, which muscle, acting with the
internal rectus of the sound side, allows of a conjugate deviation
of the eyes towards the opposite side, with well-marked <i>nystagmus</i>&mdash;of
a coarse type&mdash;on attempting to correct this deviation.</p>

<p><i>Retraction of the head and neck.</i> Retraction of the head and neck,
stiffness of the nuchal muscles, and even opisthotonos, may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
observed. The existence of these symptoms is always suggestive
of meningeal infection, but an abscess of considerable size, even when
situated in the anterior part of the lateral lobe of the cerebellum, may
so exercise pressure in the downward direction as to cork up that
part of the cerebellum which normally extends into the mouth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
foramen magnum. The neighbouring upper cervical nerves may then
be irritated or compressed.</p>

<p><i>Yawning.</i> Frequent purposeless yawning is said to be pathognomonic
of cerebellar disease (see <a href="#Page165">p. 165</a>).</p>

<p><i>Attitude in bed.</i> More commonly the patient lies curled up in
bed in the position of cerebral irritation, perhaps more frequently
with the sound side upwards.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Frontal abscess.</b> The abscess is usually dependent on
long-continued suppuration in the frontal sinus, with deficient
drainage and spread of disease to the surrounding bone. The abscess
may be situated in close relation to the focus of the disease, but, more
commonly, it occupies a more posterior position, so much so that
direct pressure is exercised on the corona radiata proceeding from
the pre-Rolandic or motor area. It would appear also that definite
localizing symptoms do not arise until the abscess has attained considerable
size. The <i>general symptoms</i> peculiar to all cases of brain
abscess are perhaps less definite when the abscess is frontal in position.
Thus, although headache may be localized to the frontal region, and
although optic neuritis may be present, yet vomiting, alterations in
pulse-rate and in respiratory rhythm are less marked than usual.</p>

<p>The <i>localizing symptoms</i> are often reasonably definite, so much
so that but little difficulty may be experienced in arriving at a
diagnosis.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of the abscess formation motor irritation
may predominate, with the development of <i>fits of the Jacksonian
type</i>, the lower and more anterior motor areas being first and mainly
affected. More commonly, however, attention will be directed towards
the nature of the trouble by <i>paresis or paralysis of the opposite side of
the body</i>. In this case also the lower motor areas&mdash;those responsible
for the opposite side of the face and upper extremity (also the
motor speech-area on the left side of the brain)&mdash;are first and chiefly
involved. In some cases&mdash;more especially when the abscess is of
considerable size&mdash;definite hemiplegia may result.</p>

<p>In cases of frontal abscess, the <i>mental condition</i> of the patient
demands special consideration. Some definite degree of moral perversion
will usually be noticed, the patient&mdash;presuming that he is in
a conscious condition&mdash;making himself as objectionable as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
He will upset his food, disarrange his bedclothes, disobey orders, and
even pass his urine and f&aelig;ces in his bed though well aware of his
wrong-doing. When questioned he answers with suspicion, when
examined he demands to know the why and the wherefore of the
various details of the investigation. An ophthalmoscopic examination
is especially difficult to carry out in a satisfactory manner. In
a case recently under my care&mdash;one in which a frontal abscess was
drained three times before a cure was obtained&mdash;these curious mental
perversions were observed each time, and the patient subsequently
acknowledged that he had performed the various acts wittingly,
but was unable to deny himself the opportunity of irritating those
around him.</p>

<p>It has been stated that these mental changes are only to be
observed when the abscess involves the <i>left</i> frontal lobe. In my own
experience no such lateral differentiation has been noticed.</p>

<p><i>Anosmia</i> may be present if the patient is in a condition to respond
to the tests requisite to prove the defect. In most cases, however,
considerable difficulty will be experienced in applying the tests, and
the results obtained are too variable. Anosmia will be associated
with impaired power of taste.</p>

<p><i>Pupillary changes.</i> &#8216;If the abscess is of large size, the pupil on
the same side is in a state of stabile mydriasis; if small, it may be
sluggish and contracted.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>The <span class="smcap lowercase">TERMINAL</span> stage.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">In <i>fatal</i> cases death results from the
pressure exercised by the expanding abscess on the bulbar centres,
or from the bursting of the abscess into the ventricular or meningeal
spaces. During this terminal stage the pulse becomes very rapid,
the respiration irregular and Cheyne-Stokes in character, whilst the
temperature rises rapidly, reaching 105-110 degrees F. Invasion of
the lateral ventricle is evidenced by violent convulsions, rigidity of
the extremities, opisthotonos, retraction of the head, trepidation, and
prostration. The pupils become widely dilated, and remain in that
condition till death ensues.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">In the operative treatment of <i>otitic temporo-sphenoidal
and cerebellar abscess</i> two courses are available:&mdash;(1) to
trephine directly over the abscess through the squamous or cerebellar<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
regions, postponing mastoid exploration till a later date (the two-stage
operation); and (2) to carry out the complete mastoid operation,
searching for the &#8216;stalk&#8217; of the abscess, and draining the abscess into
the now-united middle ear and antrum (the one-stage operation).</p>

<p>The former course is advocated by many general surgeons, the
latter is the one usually pursued by the aural surgeon. The advantages
claimed for the former method&mdash;the direct trephining method&mdash;are
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The general condition of the patient is often of so serious
a nature as to prohibit the more prolonged procedures essential to
the mastoid exploration.</p>

<p>(2) When the exploration is conducted from the infected middle
ear, an unsuccessful attempt to find the abscess carries with it an
appreciable risk of meningeal and brain infection. Unsuccessful
exploration through the &#8216;clean&#8217; squamous and cerebellar regions
presents no such disadvantages.</p>

<p>(3) The drainage as supplied through the trephine hole is often
superior to that provided by dilating up the &#8216;stalk&#8217; of the abscess
into the middle ear.</p>

<p>(4) Many general surgeons do not possess that intimate acquaintance
with the anatomy of the ear which is necessary to carry out a
complicated aural operation.</p>

<p>Each case must be considered on its own merits, but I am inclined
to advocate the two-stage method when the diagnosis is reasonably
clear that the patient is suffering from temporo-sphenoidal or cerebellar
abscess, mastoid exploration being carried out as soon as the
patient has recovered from the first operation. When, however,
considerable doubt exists as to the position of the abscess&mdash;or the
nature of the complication in general&mdash;it is then advisable to start by
exploration of the mastoid and aural regions, further measures being
adopted according to the conditions found at the time of operation.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft blankbefore75"><b>1. The two-stage operation.</b></h6>

<p><i>Trephining for temporo-sphenoidal abscess.</i> A point is chosen on
the scalp which lies between 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> and 2 inches above the centre of the
external auditory meatus, and a bradawl is there introduced so as
to indent the external table of the skull. A small scalp-flap is framed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
one presenting an upward convexity, and all bleeding controlled.
The pin of the trephine is applied to the spot previously indicated
on the bone and the disk removed. On account of the absence of
diploic tissue and consequent approximation of the two tables of
the skull, care must be taken to avoid injury to the posterior branch
of the middle meningeal artery and to the bulging dura mater.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550" id="Fig79">
<img src="images/illo265.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="589" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79. The Exposure of a Temporo-sphenoidal Abscess.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The dura is then inspected and palpated; absence of pulsation,
loss of lustre and tenseness, indicate the probable adjacency of the
abscess cavity. The membrane should be crucially incised, all
meningeal vessels that cross the line proposed for section being first
under-run on either side of that line. The scalpel is lightly applied
to the membrane and, as soon as the pia-arachnoid is exposed, the
section completed with the blunt-pointed scissors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span></p>

<p>The four dural flaps are turned aside and the cortex exposed.
At the very apex of the bulging brain, and avoiding all visible vessels,
a large blunt-pointed trocar and cannula or, preferably, Horsley&#8217;s
pus-evacuator is introduced and passed, for not more than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches,
in a direction inwards and slightly forwards, parallel to the roof of
the middle ear. The blades of the evacuator must be opened &#8216;once
for each quarter of an inch of brain substance penetrated&#8217; (Macewen).
If the trocar and cannula be utilized, similar precautions must be
adopted.</p>

<p>In the event of failure to find pus at the first attempt, the
evacuator is withdrawn, introduced at the same site, but now passed
in other directions&mdash;directly inwards, slightly upwards, and finally,
slightly backwards, in each case for not more than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches.</p>

<p>By wide separation of the blades of the evacuator the pus is
allowed to escape, to be immediately wiped away by the assistant.
Irrigation of the cavity should never be attempted, not so much
because of the difficulties attendant on that process, but because
of the danger of infecting the neighbouring meningeal regions.</p>

<p>Previous to withdrawal of the evacuator, a small rubber or
cigarette drainage-tube is introduced, projecting into the abscess
cavity at the one end, and brought out through the scalp-flap at the
other. It is advisable to stitch the tube in position.</p>

<p>The dural flaps are replaced in their proper position, but no
attempt is made at sewing them together. The scalp-flap is sutured
with the aid of a few salmon-gut stitches and the dressings applied.
The tube may be shortened daily, and dispensed with after seven to
ten days, according to the progress of the case.</p>

<p><i>Trephining for cerebellar abscess.</i> The abscess usually occupies
the antero-external aspect of the lateral lobe of the cerebellum.
It can be drained with advantage below the level of the lateral sinus
and behind the posterior border of the mastoid process.</p>

<p>The patient should be in the semi-prone position, the head as
forwardly flexed as the administration of the an&aelig;sthetic allows.</p>

<p>The incision starts below the external occipital protuberance,
and, following the line of the occipital crest, curves downwards along
the posterior border of the mastoid process, terminating at the apex
of that prominence. The cutaneo-muscular flap is turned down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
every precaution being taken to diminish h&aelig;morrhage, insomuch as
severe bleeding may take place from occipital vessels, and from the
mastoid and other emissary veins. H&aelig;morrhage from the former
source is controlled with forceps, that from the emissary veins by
the introduction of the end of a blunt probe into the orifice of the
foramen. More permanent occlusion can be obtained by plugging
the foramen with catgut, with a sterilized wooden match, or by means
of special ivory, bone, and wooden pegs.</p>

<p>The trephine is applied in such a manner that its circle falls well
below the lower level of the lateral sinus and behind the mastoid
process. After removal of the disk, the dura mater is cautiously
opened by crucial incision and the evacuating instrument introduced,
the cerebellum being explored in the forward and slightly inward
direction&mdash;towards the posterior aspect of the petrous bone. The
abscess should be reached within 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches from the opening in the
bone. A drainage tube is introduced, stitched in position, in the
manner described when dealing with temporo-sphenoidal abscess.
This tube should be shortened daily and dispensed with after seven
to ten days.</p>

<p><i>Trephining for frontal abscess.</i> An abscess of the frontal lobe
is generally situated so far back, and connected with the source of
the trouble (the frontal sinus) by so long a &#8216;stalk&#8217; of infection, that
considerable difficulty may be experienced in attempting drainage
from the frontal or nasal regions. Moreover, operations conducted
through the frontal region are apt to result in considerable deformity.
The operation may therefore be conducted with advantage from the
temporo-frontal region. In this situation, the bone is thin, the operation
can be conducted between the split fibres of the temporal muscle,
excellent drainage is supplied, and the scar is inconspicuous.</p>

<p>For a general description of the intermusculo-temporal operation,
the reader is referred to <a href="#Page121">p. 121</a>. In this instance, the field of operation
is shifted further forwards, otherwise the details are very similar.
The skin incision commences above and in front of the external
angular frontal process, curves along the temporal crest, and
terminates well in front of the ear. The temporal fascia is turned
down and the muscle split in the general direction of its fibres, and
well retracted on either side. The trephine is applied, the dura<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
mater incised, and the abscess evacuated and drained in the manner
previously described. The tube may be removed after seven to ten
days.</p>

<p><i>The treatment of a chronic encapsuled abscess, wherever situated.</i>
In attempting to evacuate a chronic encapsuled abscess, both the
trocar and cannula and the evacuator merely impinge against, and
tend to push aside, the dense enclosing wall of the abscess cavity.
When such obstruction is suspected, a director should be introduced
in the direction of the abscess, and the brain explored till the resistance
of the abscess-wall is encountered. With the aid of two narrow
spatul&aelig;, or other suitable instrument, the passage through the brain
is gently enlarged till the wall of the abscess becomes visible. The
margins of the passage through the brain are gently retracted and the
abscess-wall freely incised with the knife. After the evacuation of
the pus, a drainage tube can be introduced, but, as such a method
seldom permits of a permanent cure&mdash;the abscess filling up again as
soon as the tube is withdrawn&mdash;it is generally advisable to attempt
the entire removal of the abscess-wall. The cut edges of the capsular
incision are seized with narrow-bladed forceps, gentle traction applied,
and the surrounding brain substance carefully peeled away. As a rule,
there is no great difficulty attendant on this process and the h&aelig;morrhage
is seldom severe. The cavity that remains in the brain substance
is <i>lightly</i> packed with gauze, this packing being allowed to remain
for twenty-four to thirty-six hours, after which it is withdrawn and
a little fresh gauze introduced, if necessary. The cavity fills up
with extraordinary rapidity, mainly as a result of the expansion and
falling together of the surrounding brain (see <a href="#Fig86">Figs. 86 and 86a</a>).</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft blankbefore75"><b>2. The one-stage operation.</b></h6>

<p><i>Preliminary exploration of the mastoid operation, followed by an
investigation of the middle and posterior foss&aelig; of the skull.</i> To expose
the mastoid antrum, the incision commences immediately above and
behind the ear, and, carried down to the bone throughout, terminates
near the tip of the mastoid process. The soft tissues are peeled away
in the forward direction and the cartilaginous ear detached from the
posterior and upper boundaries of the bony auditory meatus.</p>

<p>Macewen&#8217;s suprameatal triangle and the supramastoid crest are<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
identified, the former landmark being taken as a guide to the communication
between the mastoid antrum and the middle ear, the latter
representing the uppermost limit of the field of operation.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>With the aid of the hammer and chisel the bone is chipped away
till the antrum is exposed&mdash;on an average this will be situated about
three-fifths of an inch deep from the surface. The opening necessarily
becomes funnel-shaped, but it should be made as complete as circumstances
permit.</p>

<p>As soon as the antrum is exposed, the seeker or nerve-protector
should be introduced into the aditus, acting as a protector to the
underlying external semicircular canal and facial nerve, and the
&#8216;bridge&#8217; of bone, which now intervenes between the antrum and the
middle ear, chiselled away, in the manner indicated in <a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>.</p>

<p>The field of operation is now carefully cleansed, cholesteatomata,
bone-debris, and ossicles being gently removed, and&mdash;with the aid
of a head-lamp&mdash;a careful search instituted for fistulous tracts,
carious bone, &amp;c. This search must be carried out with the greatest
gentleness for fear of inducing further complications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span></p>

<p>Subsequent procedures vary according to the nature of the conditions
found. <span class="nowrap">Thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. When the diagnosis is uncertain and when the boundaries
of the cavity appear fairly healthy, the operation may terminate at
this point, a post-meatal flap being formed and the cavity lightly
plugged with gauze. The proximal end of the gauze plug is brought
out through the enlarged auditory meatus and the ear-flap sewn
back with a few salmon-gut sutures.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>2. When the evidence points to implication of the <i>middle</i> fossa,
the scalp incision is prolonged upwards for about 1 inch and the
soft parts retracted. The supra-tegmental extra-dural space can be
exposed either by chiselling away the osseous roof of antrum and
middle ear, or by means of a separate opening above the level of the
supramastoid crest. In the event of the discovery of an <i>extra-dural</i>
collection of pus, the purulent material is gently wiped away, free
drainage supplied, and the wound closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span></p>

<p>In both this and the preceding case, the progress of the case
during the ensuing twenty-four to forty-eight hours will prove
whether adequate measures have been adopted.</p>

<p>When the symptoms are suggestive of <i>brain abscess</i>, when no
extra-dural collection is discovered, and when the dura mater is tense
and discoloured, then it becomes necessary to explore the brain.
This can be carried out through an opening made in the tegmen
or above the level of the supramastoid crest. Which route should
be utilized depends on the local conditions. As a general rule, it is
advisable to explore through the tegmen when a sinus exists in that
situation, and above the supramastoid crest under all other circumstances.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>In the latter case, the dura mater is incised crucially and the
bulging brain explored in the manner indicated on <a href="#Page266">p. 266</a>. The
mastoid region should first be cleansed and packed with gauze, but,
even with such precautions, it is obvious that there is some risk
of contaminating membranes and brain in the event of failure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
discover the abscess cavity&mdash;an argument in favour of exploring
through the &#8216;clean&#8217; squamous region (see <a href="#Page264">p. 264</a>).</p>

<p>3. When the evidence points to implication of the <i>posterior</i>
fossa, an incision is carried backwards, from the mid-point of the
post-aural incision, for about 2 inches, and the soft parts retracted
upwards and downwards. With the chisel (or gouge) and hammer,
the bone is freely cut away so as to expose (1) the lateral sinus, and
(2) the dura mater below and behind the curve of the sinus. As soon
as the sinus is exposed, the dura mater may be separated from the
bone and the subsinus region exposed with the aid of craniectomy
forceps.</p>

<p>The extra-dural space between the posterior aspect of the petrous
bone and the lateral sinus region is first inspected, and, in the event
of the discovery of a collection of pus, this is gently wiped away and
further exploration postponed till the occasion should prove the
necessity.</p>

<p>When the indications are of such a nature as to demand <i>exploration
of the cerebellum</i>, the mastoid region is first cleansed and packed with
gauze, after which the dura mater is incised either in front or behind
the sinus according to the probable situation of the abscess cavity.
After the evacuation of the abscess a drainage tube is stitched in
position in the manner previously indicated.</p>

<h5 class="left blankbefore75"><b>Difficulties and dangers attendant on the process of
trephining for brain abscess.</b></h5>

<div class="fsize90">

<p><i>Failure to find the abscess</i> is usually dependent on one of the
following <span class="nowrap">causes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The abscess may be missed if the localizing features are
misleading, if the abscess be small, and if the exploring instrument
be passed in a faulty direction or to an insufficient depth.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The abscess may be traversed but not tapped if unsuitable
exploring instruments be used&mdash;an aspirating syringe, for instance,
through which the thick pus will not pass. Even when suitable
instruments are used, the attempt to evacuate the abscess may fail
if the operator does not carry out what may be called a system of
progressive exploration, that is to say, if he does not periodically
open the blades of the evacuator (see <a href="#Page266">p. 266</a>).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The abscess may be encountered but not penetrated if the
surgeon has to deal with a chronic abscess, the wall of which is merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
pushed aside by the advancing instrument (see chronic abscess of the
brain, <a href="#Page268">p. 268</a>).</p>

<p><i>Complications</i> arising during and after the evacuation of the
abscess are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Leaking into the pia-arachnoid and the development of
general meningeal infection.</p>

<p>2. Perforation of the ventricular spaces.</p>

<p>3. H&aelig;morrhage.</p>

<p>4. Respiratory failure.</p>

<p>5. Osteomyelitis of the neighbouring diploic tissue.</p>

<p><i>General meningeal infection</i> will bring about a fatal result. Fortunately,
the general rise of intracranial pressure and the formation
of adhesions between the brain and the overlying membranes tend
to prevent its development.</p>

<p><i>Perforation of the ventricular spaces</i> may occur under two conditions:
(1) when the abscess is associated with internal hydrocephalus,
and (2) when the exploring instrument is passed too far.</p>

<p><i>H&aelig;morrhage</i> is seldom serious when the operation is carried out
with a light hand, all visible vessels being carefully avoided. In the
event of its occurrence, it may be controlled by lightly packing the
cavity with gauze.</p>

<p><i>Respiratory failure</i> is most liable to occur when the surgeon is
operating for cerebellar abscess. In the event of its occurrence the
surgeon should complete his trephining with the utmost expedition,
thus relieving the intracranial pressure. Under favourable circumstances,
the respiratory rhythm is soon restored. In the more serious
cases, artificial respiration should be attempted whilst the surgeon
carries on his manipulations, opening the skull as rapidly as possible.</p>

<h3>MENINGITIS</h3>

<p>Previous to entering into the question of general meningeal
infection, some allusion must be made to the rarer forms of meningitis.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Serous meningitis.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Quincke demonstrated in 1895 the existence
of a serous form of meningitis, one characterized by a sero-fibrinous
exudate. He showed that, just as we have to deal with
a serous or purulent pleurisy, so we have to consider the possibility
of a serous or purulent form of meningitis.</p>

<p>The exudate appears at first sight to differ but slightly from
normal cerebro-spinal fluid, being clear, yielding the normal chemical
reactions of that fluid, and occupying the subarachnoid region.
Later on it becomes slightly turbid, contains a fair quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
of albumen, and is proportionately rich in cellular elements&mdash;lymphocytes
and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The membranes are
swollen, the vessels dilated, whilst occasionally many minute h&aelig;morrhages
may so allow of the escape of red blood-corpuscles as to impart
to the exudate a yellowish-red coloration. At a still later stage the
exudate becomes flocculent as a result of the deposition of a fibrinous
coagulation, a gum-like material forming over the surface of the brain.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Pachymeningitis externa.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Pachymeningitis externa is almost
necessarily dependent on disease of the middle ear, on suppuration
in the accessory sinuses of the nose, and on infected fractures of the
vault and base. The inflammatory changes primarily involve the
external aspect of the dura mater, the external surface of which is
injected, roughened with fibrinous exudate, and, in the more chronic
cases, covered with granulations. In itself the process seldom gives
rise to symptoms, but so soon as the inner surface of the dura shares
in the affection (meningitis), or the infection spreads to the venous
sinuses (sinus thrombosis), or to the brain (brain abscess), definite
symptoms arise pointing to the nature and character of the change.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Pachymeningitis interna and pachymeningitis interna
h&aelig;morrhagica.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">As the direct result of alcoholic excess, of
syphilitic infection, and of trauma, the inner surface of the dura
mater loses its shiny appearance, becomes opaque and thickened,
especially in the region of the falx cerebri and over the convexity
of the brain. The sodden and &#339;dematous condition of the dura
gives rise to a fibrinous and membranous exudate, terminating in
the formation of false membranes&mdash;one of the factors in the formation
of so-called &#8216;arachnoid cysts&#8217; (see <a href="#Page203">p. 203</a>). These membranes are
seen to be attached to the dura mater by means of newly-formed
vessels, some of which may rupture, giving origin to blood exudate
sufficing to impart to the membranes a brownish-red coloration.
In the more marked cases, especially in those of a recurrent nature,
the membranes partake of a lamellated type. Occasionally, the
h&aelig;morrhages are more excessive, giving rise to the formation of subdural
h&aelig;matomata from the partial absorption of which the various
types of pachymeningitis h&aelig;morrhagica arise.</p>

<p>These rarer forms of meningitis seldom give rise to such definite
symptoms as to allow the surgeon to carry out surgical procedures in<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
their earlier stages. Later on, by reason of the development of cystic
accumulations of fluid or other complication, operation may be carried
out with a reasonable degree of success. The operative technique
adapted to the individual case is discussed under appropriate headings&mdash;Jacksonian
epilepsy, meningeal cysts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is possible that some criticism may be aroused with regard to
the non-inclusion of tuberculous meningitis. Insomuch, however, as
I have operated on a considerable number of cases of tuberculous
meningitis&mdash;some intentionally from a decompression point of view,
others by reason of doubtful
diagnosis&mdash;and have never
brought about more than some
temporary alleviation, I have
come to regard such cases as
beyond the realms of surgery.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Acute lepto-meningitis.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">This condition will be considered
under the more familiar,
though less correct, designation&mdash;<i>meningitis</i>.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made
to classify the various forms of
meningitis on a bacterial basis.
When, however, it is realized
that almost any known form of organism may be present in the exudate,
and that the symptoms dependent on these various infections closely
resemble one another, merely differing in their acuteness and intensity,
it would appear that some other form of classification is preferable.</p>

<p>The following method of classification will <span class="nowrap">suffice:&mdash;</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>1.</b> <b>Meningitis of traumatic origin.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The organisms either
obtain direct entrance to the meningeal space by means of a compound
fracture of the vault or base of the skull, or reach their destination
along the course of the numerous emissary and diploic veins
that bring the extra- and intra-cranial channels into communication.</p>

<h5 class="left"><b>2.</b> <b>Meningitis secondary to disease of neighbouring
regions.</b></h5>

<p>(1) The accessory sinuses of the nose and ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span></p>

<p>(2) The bones of the skull.</p>

<p>(3) The soft parts&mdash;scalp, orbit, nose, and face.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>3.</b> <b>Meningitis secondary to disease of more distant
regions.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Through the medium of the blood-stream bacteria may
be carried to the meningeal region in many acute infections&mdash;more
especially in diseases of the lung.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Some anatomical considerations of meningitis.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The <i>pia</i>
is closely applied to the surface of the brain, dipping down into all
the fissures, both major and minor. The <i>arachnoid</i> is only reflected
into the greater fissures&mdash;the mesial longitudinal fissure, the fissure
of Sylvius, Rolando, &amp;c. The pia and arachnoid are therefore
separated from one another by a potential space over the convolutions
themselves, and by an actual space in the region of many of the
cortical fissures.</p>

<p>On the under aspect of the brain the two membranes are so
disposed and so separated from one another as to form three great
basins or cistern&aelig;, three great spaces acting as a water-bed for the
brain. These are the <i>cisterna magna</i>, the arachnoid bridging over
the wide interval between the back part of the under surface of the
cerebellum and the medulla, the <i>cisterna pontis</i>, the angular space
between the pons, medulla, and cerebellum, and the <i>cisterna basalis</i>,
the arachnoid there covering in the structure situated in the interpeduncular
space, including the Circle of Willis.</p>

<p>The subarachnoid space, both cortical and basal, is traversed by
numerous trabecul&aelig; which, passing from one membrane to the other,
break up the space into innumerable small compartments, all containing
cerebro-spinal fluid and all intercommunicating. The cerebral
vessels ramify in the space, the tributaries being supported by the
framework and bathed in the fluid.</p>

<p>All cranial nerves carry with them in their emergence from the
skull a process of both pia and arachnoid, variable in extent, but so
arranged that the nerve trunk is surrounded for some distance by
a funnel-shaped process of membrane, the cerebral cerebro-spinal
fluid being thus brought into connexion with the cervical lymphatic
spaces.</p>

<p>With respect to the origin of the cerebro-spinal fluid and its
wave of flow, the researches of Leonard Hill tend to prove that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
is formed from the lining ependyma and choroid plexuses of the three
main ventricles of the brain, passing thence into the spinal cerebro-spinal
region and, by means of the foramina of Majendie, Key, and
Retzius&mdash;apertures in the roof of the fourth ventricle&mdash;on to the
surface of the brain. From this latter region there appears to be
a general tendency for the fluid to pass upwards from the basal aspect
of the brain towards the superior longitudinal sinus where it is
again absorbed, probably through the medium of the Pacchionian
bodies and lacun&aelig; laterales of the venous sinus.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig84">
<img src="images/illo277.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="557" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span> <span class="smcap">Basal Meningitis secondary to Temporo-sphenoidal
Abscess.</span></p>
</div>

<p>From these few anatomical facts it is manifest (1) that a subarachnoid
purulent effusion has every opportunity of spreading
widely over the surface of the brain, and (2) that inflammation and
its results in the immediate neighbourhood of the roof of the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
ventricle will tend to impede the normal flow of cerebro-spinal fluid
through the foramina in that region, thus inducing a degree of internal
hydrocephalus directly proportionate to the degree of obstruction.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is obvious that the anatomical arrangements
are entirely opposed to the possibility of providing adequate drainage
in cases of general meningeal infection. It has been suggested that
trephine holes should be made on either side of the skull, and that
the intervening meningeal space should be washed out between the
two apertures. It is, however, impossible to attain such a result,
not only because of the futility of attempting to wash through the
subarachnoid meshwork, but also on account of the outward bulging
of the brain substance through the trephine holes and the corking
up of those apertures.</p>

<p>The pus rapidly spreads over the surface of the cerebrum and
over the base of the brain, along the sheaths of the emerging
cranial nerves, and down the spinal canal. Associated with vascular
dilatation there is extensive leucocyte extravasation into the perivascular
spaces, the course of the line of the attack being mapped
out by white and yellow lines and areas of exudation. Insomuch, also,
as the meningeal vessels are in direct continuity with those of the cortex
itself, it follows that a well-developed case of meningitis implies a corresponding
degree of cerebritis, with red or white softening of the brain
substance according to the degree of h&aelig;morrhagic extravasation.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Meningitis is generally sudden in onset
and ushered in by a rigor, frequently of a most intense character.
Headache is always a marked feature, commonly diffuse, but sometimes
localized to the region primarily and mainly affected. The
headache is intense and exacerbations are marked, the patient crying
out in his agony. There is great mental irritability and all attempts
at clinical examination are strenuously resisted.</p>

<p>After the initial rigor the temperature remains high, with occasional
remissions during the early hours of the morning. Vomiting
may be frequent and violent, but, according to my observations, this
has not been a conspicuous feature.</p>

<p>The pulse-rate is increased, whilst, in the early stages, the volume
is full and the tension high. The skin is burning hot and dry,
except during the post-rigor periods when sweating predominates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span></p>

<p>The face is flushed, often turgid, and the eyes are bright. General
restlessness is a marked feature.</p>

<p>The more <i>localizing</i> features may be arranged in three groups:
intellectual, motor, and sensory.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Intellectual symptoms.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The condition of the patient is one of
great restlessness, increasing sometimes to actual violence and mania.
Attendants are usually required to restrain his movements, and,
tossing about in bed, crying out in his pain, muttering and wandering in
his delirium, he offers a typical clinical picture of cerebral irritation.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Motor symptoms.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The motor symptoms vary according to
the region mainly involved, cortex or base. In the <i>former</i> case,
excitation results in twitchings and convulsions of the regions supplied
by the cortical areas involved. Convulsions may be general or confined
to a certain group of muscles, the former condition usually
present in children, the latter more often observed in adults and
occasionally partaking of the Jacksonian type. Convulsions may be
associated with contractures of the limbs, the flexors mainly affected
in such a manner that an attitude of general flexion may be assumed.
The patient appears to suffer pain when attempts are made to
straighten the limbs. In any case, such attempts are resisted.</p>

<p>Implication of the <i>base of the brain</i>. This is evidenced by symptoms
sufficiently definite. Thus, the following symptoms may be
<span class="nowrap">observed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Optic neuritis.</i></p>

<p><i>Myosis and squints</i>, from involvement of the third, fourth, and
sixth nerves.</p>

<p><i>Trismus</i>, from implication of the third division of the fifth nerve.</p>

<p><i>Facial paralysis</i>, from implication of the seventh nerve.</p>

<p><i>Deafness</i>, from involvement of the eighth nerve.</p>

<p><i>Dysphagia and dyspn&#339;a</i>, from involvement of the ninth and
tenth nerves.</p>

<p><i>Rigidity of the neck and torticollis</i>, from involvement of the
eleventh nerve.</p>

<p><i>Retraction of the head and neck</i>, from involvement of the posterior
divisions of the upper cervical nerves.</p>

<p><i>Opisthotonos</i>, from the involvement of the posterior divisions
of the upper cervical nerves, sometimes of so excessive a nature that<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
the body is bent backwards to such a degree that the head and heels
are almost brought into contact. More rarely, pleurosthotonos or
lateral flexion is observed.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Sensory and other phenomena.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Amongst such symptoms
may be mentioned cutaneous hyper&aelig;sthesis, photophobia, and vaso-motor
changes&mdash;the last-named evidenced by flushings, sweats, and
<i>t&acirc;che c&eacute;r&eacute;brale</i>.</p>

<p>Rapid emaciation, anorexia, and distaste for all nourishment
are the rule, whilst retention of urine, albuminuria, and glycosuria
have been observed.</p>

<p>The reflexes, both deep and superficial, are often increased.
Kernig&#8217;s sign is generally present.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The period of depression.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The acute stage seldom persists
more than two or three days, the period of excitation giving place
to that of depression. The transition is usually of a rapid nature.
The depression stage is dependent on exhaustion of the cortical and
basal centres.</p>

<p>The temperature remains high, rising towards the evening and
falling a degree or more in the early hours of the morn. Death usually
takes place when the temperature is at its highest.</p>

<p>The pulse may become slower as the intracranial pressure increases,
but, more commonly, as the result of toxic poisoning, the rate increases
whilst the rhythm becomes irregular and the tension lowered.</p>

<p>Respiration may partake of the Cheyne-Stokes type, whilst the
impaired &aelig;ration of the blood and the weak action of the heart are
evidenced by cyanosis of the face, &#339;dema of the lower extremities, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Death, primarily due to respiratory failure, is often preceded by
general twitchings or convulsions.</p>

<p>The whole course of the illness seldom lasts more than a week,
the more acute cases terminating within two or three days.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Whether threatening, developing, or obviously
present, the patient should be treated with urotropin (see <a href="#Page116">p. 116</a>).
In its early stages of development immediate operation affords some
hope of cure, such treatment having as its basis the supply of adequate
drainage. The source of the infection must be removed&mdash;so far as
circumstances permit&mdash;the dura mater freely incised, and the pia-arachnoid
region so opened up as to allow of the escape of some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
purulent or semi-purulent fluid. The wound is largely allowed to
remain open, packed with gauze. The predominant organism may be
isolated and, if time allows, suitable vaccine treatment instituted. In
the meantime, 20 to 40 cc. of pyogenes serum should be administered.</p>

<p>From the point of view of diagnosis, <i>lumbar puncture</i> should
never be omitted. The fluid escapes at high tension, is turbid and
contains many polymorphonuclear leucocytes and organisms, the
latter verified with the greatest advantage after centrifugalization.
Repeated lumbar punctures are also said to be of some benefit with
respect to <i>treatment</i>.</p>

<h3>SINUS THROMBOSIS</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Lateral sinus thrombosis.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Soon after entering on its course
across the mastoid process the lateral sinus presents a well-marked
S-shaped curve. This sigmoid sinus bulges markedly forwards&mdash;especially
on the right side&mdash;towards the region of the mastoid cells
and antrum, so much so that a mere shell of bone intervenes between
the sinus on the one hand and the antral region on the other. Indeed,
the relations are so intimate that one would expect a more frequent
occurrence of lateral sinus thrombosis. Furthermore, the sinus receives
numerous venous communications from the mastoid cells, antrum, and
other parts of the temporal bone, conspicuous amongst the last-named
group of vessels being the mastoid emissary vein which, passing inwards
at the upper and posterior border of the mastoid process, connects
the posterior auricular and occipital veins with the lateral sinus.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is obvious that any acute or chronic
infective process originating either in the aural region or in the
neighbourhood can readily infect the sinus by direct propagation of
organisms along one or more of these inter-communicating vessels
(thrombo-phlebitis).</p>

<p>The sinus may also become infected in middle-ear disease by the
more gradual process of mining and sapping, the osseous barrier
between the antrum and sinus being progressively destroyed by the
backward progress of the aural disease. The sinus may erect an
additional barrier by throwing out granulations (external pachymeningitis)
against the invading host, but, in the event of the attack
overcoming the defence, sinus thrombosis may result, at first perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span>
of a non-infective type but soon becoming definitely septic, the clot
softening and disintegrating (osteo-phlebitis).</p>

<p>There can be no question that middle-ear disease is responsible
for the very great majority of cases of lateral sinus thrombosis, and
whether the infection takes place by extension of thrombus along the
connecting veins (thrombo-phlebitis), or after destruction of the osseous
barrier (osteo-thrombosis), the results are more or less identical.</p>

<p>Thrombosis first occurs in that part of the sinus which is in
closest relation to the primary cause of the infection, the clot rapidly
increasing in size until the lumen of the sinus is entirely obliterated.
In its early stages the thrombus is of a chocolate colour, softening
at a later date and breaking down into a purulent material. Many
varieties of bacteria may be present though the infection is mainly
dependent on the presence of the streptococcus pyogenes.</p>

<p>Two changes may now occur:&mdash;(1) the central portion of the
thrombus, having softened into a purulent material, may be limited
by the firmer thrombus in front and behind; and (2) the thrombus
may extend into the neighbouring and connecting venous channels
<i>downwards</i> along the course of the internal jugular vein, <i>backwards</i>
along the course of the lateral sinus, <i>inwards</i> along the course of the
superior petrosal sinus, <i>outwards</i> along the line of the mastoid emissary
vein, <i>downwards</i> through the posterior condyloid foramen, and <i>inwards</i>
along meningeal veins.</p>

<p>The <b>symptomatology</b> may be considered as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Symptoms dependent on the extension of the thrombus to
neighbouring venous and lymphatic channels.</p>

<p>(2) Symptoms resulting from toxic absorption or dependent on
the transmission of infected material to other parts of the body.</p>

<p>1. <i>Symptoms dependent on the extension of the thrombus to neighbouring
venous and lymphatic channels.</i> When the thrombus spreads
downwards along the course of the <i>internal jugular vein</i>, there is
swelling and tenderness along the line of the vein. The vessel, though
thrombosed in its upper part&mdash;perhaps throughout its whole extent&mdash;is
itself seldom palpable, the cervical swelling usually being dependent
on associated lymphadenitis and lymphangitis. In those few cases
where the thrombosed vein can be felt, resembling a &#8216;buried lead
pencil&#8217;, the thrombus is sometimes of the non-infective type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span></p>

<p>The combined venous and lymphatic involvement causes &#339;dema
of the tissues, pain, and rigidity on attempted movement. The anterior
and external jugular veins may become engorged from the extra
strain thrown upon them. Subsequently, the inflamed parts may
break down and extensive cervical suppuration result.</p>

<p>When the thrombus spreads <i>backwards</i> along the course of the
<i>lateral sinus</i>, the coagulation process may extend as far as the torcula
and even further. Evidence as to the nature and extent of the process
is not always apparent, though one expects to find some &#339;dema
of the overlying scalp tissues.</p>

<p>When the process spreads <i>inwards</i> along the course of the <i>superior
petrosal sinus</i> there is considerable risk of involvement of the corresponding
cavernous sinus, possibly of the opposite sinus also (see <a href="#Page288">p. 288</a>).</p>

<p>When the process spreads <i>outwards</i> along the course of the <i>mastoid
emissary vein</i>, &#339;dema, and dilatation of veins in the post-auricular
region are observed, associated with tenderness on palpation. This is
most apparent at the upper and posterior border of the mastoid process.</p>

<p>When the thrombus spreads <i>downwards</i> along the course of the
<i>posterior condyloid vein</i>, there may be some &#339;dema and pain on
pressure in the upper part of the posterior triangle of the neck,
associated with glandular enlargement in the region. These symptoms
are dependent on the connexion established by the posterior condyloid
vein between the sigmoid sinus and the deep veins of the neck.</p>

<p>When the thrombus extends <i>inwards</i> along the meningeal veins,
meningitis, meningo-cerebritis, and cerebral abscess result.</p>

<p>2. <i>Symptoms resulting from toxic absorption or dependent on the
transmission of infected material to other parts of the body.</i></p>

<p><i>Optic neuritis</i> is present, according to Hunter Tod, in about 50 per
cent. cases. It develops rapidly and attains a high degree of intensity.</p>

<p><i>Headache</i> is usually intense in character, persistent, but little
remedied by drugs and presenting marked exacerbations. It is often
most acute over the affected region.</p>

<p>The <i>mental condition</i> of the patient is subject to variation.
In the average case mental symptoms are quite disproportionate to
the severity of the disease. Sometimes the patient is cheerful, perhaps
rather excited, retaining his faculties to the last, in other cases&mdash;as
the result of excessive toxic poisoning&mdash;he lies in a stuporose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
typhoid-like state. When the thrombus is associated with meningitis,
meningeal symptoms predominate.</p>

<p><i>Vomiting</i> is often a conspicuous feature, generally of the so-called
&#8216;cerebral&#8217; type, a regurgitation without nausea and retching.</p>

<p>The <i>pulse</i> is rapid, the rhythm irregular, and the tension lowered.</p>

<p>The <i>temperature</i>. The formation of the thrombus is usually
notified by the advent of one or more severe rigors, the temperature
rising to 103&deg; or more. During the height of the illness the temperature
is high but remittent, and rigors are frequent. The occurrence
of a series of rigors is almost certainly indicative of sinus thrombosis.
Any marked remission of temperature is succeeded by profuse sweating,
but, with this exception, the skin remains dry and burning.</p>

<p>Each rigor implies the extension of the thrombus to other
venous channels or the transference of infected particles, by means
of the blood-stream, to other parts of the body. In the young general
convulsions are often observed.</p>

<p>The tongue is brown and dry, the breath foul and diarrh&#339;a of
common occurrence. The skin may be jaundiced, and septic rashes
are prone to develop. The liver and spleen may be enlarged and
tender. Cough and foul sputum point to pulmonary infarction.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The mastoid antrum is rapidly exposed and the
conditions investigated. The bone is then chiselled away in the backward
direction, with the hammer and gouge, so as to expose the lateral
sinus. The question then arises as to the condition of the sinus.
This is a matter that may require considerable experience. The
surgeon should be guided, not so much by exploratory puncture as
by the surroundings and general appearance of the sinus. Thus, the
absence of bleeding from the mastoid emissary vein during the process
of exposure is very significant of sinus thrombosis. Again, whilst
the normal sinus pulsates, is of dark blue colour and presents a shining
surface, the thrombosed channel may be covered with pale granulations
or obscured by fibrinous deposit, it does not pulsate, and
appears of a yellow or deep purple colour. Between it and the bone
there may be a collection of purulent matter. In the event of doubt,
the surrounding regions should be carefully protected with gauze,
after which the sinus may be punctured with a needle. The absence
of fluid blood is conclusive of thrombosis.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span></p>

<p>In the event of the surgeon concluding that thrombosis is present,
subsequent procedures vary according to the extent of the thrombus.
Thus, <i>when the clot appears to terminate above the jugular bulb</i>, a strip
of gauze is inserted between the bone and the parietal wall of the sinus
so as to obliterate the lumen of the sinus on the cardiac side of the clot.</p>

<p>The danger of further extension of the clot being thus obviated,
the bone is nibbled away in the backward direction till at least half an
inch of healthy vessel is exposed on the occipital side of the thrombus.
A second gauze plug is then introduced so as to obliterate the sinus
lumen in that region also.</p>

<p>In the interval between the two plugs the sinus is freely laid open,
all clot and granulations being gently curetted and washed away.
Some bleeding may take place during these procedures, from the
mouths of certain vessels entering the sinus between the two compressed
regions. This is in itself a favourable symptom, insomuch
as it proves that the thrombotic process has not extended in those
directions. This h&aelig;morrhage may be controlled with gauze plugs.
The parietal sinus wall in direct relation to the thrombus is freely
cut away, after which the whole field is lightly packed with gauze
and the ear sewn back into position. The main portion of the wound
is left open, the sinus plugs being brought to the surface whilst those
inserted into the combined middle ear and antrum emerge from the
external auditory meatus.</p>

<p>All gauze-plugs may be withdrawn after twenty-four to thirty-six
hours, the wound cleansed and lightly repacked. This process is
continued daily till all is healed.</p>

<p><i>When the clot extends into the jugular bulb, and when the
jugular vein appears to be involved</i>, it is necessary to expose and
ligature the vein in the neck, thus preventing further extension of
coagulation and diminishing the risk of general infection. This
measure should be carried out before the lateral sinus is laid open.
With fresh gloves and another set of instruments, the vein is exposed
so as to allow the application of two ligatures, and the division of the
vessel between those two ligatures. If possible, the ligatures should
be applied above the level of the entrance of the common facial vein.
In all cases, however, the application must be carried out, if possible,
below the lower limit of the thrombus. After the vein has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
divided, the upper end may be dissected in such a manner as to allow
of its being brought to the surface of the wound and there anchored.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the neck-incision is sewn up and protected with
collodion gauze. The surgeon then returns to the mastoid and sinus
regions, completing the exposure of the sinus and laying it open
freely to the surface. At the termination of these procedures, an
attempt may be made, by irrigation between the open sinus above
and jugular vein below, to wash away all thrombus contained in the
intervening portion of the vessel.</p>

<p>Finally, both sinus and aural regions are packed with gauze, in a
manner similar to that described above. Dressings are reapplied as
circumstances demand, and the wounds allowed to heal by granulation.</p>

<p>The great frequency of a streptococcus pyogenes infection
justifies one in the early administration of anti-streptococcic serum
(20 to 40 c.c. of Burroughs Wellcome&#8217;s &#8216;Pyogenes&#8217;) followed by an
autogenous vaccine as soon as that can be prepared.</p>

<p>In typical cases no great difficulty will be experienced in
diagnosing between brain abscess, meningitis, and lateral sinus
thrombosis. In many cases, however, two or more of these conditions
may be co-existent. Thus, both brain abscess and lateral
sinus thrombosis are often complicated by the presence of a meningeal
infection. Again, the undue prominence of abdominal, cardiac,
or pulmonary symptoms&mdash;more especially in cases of lateral
sinus thrombosis&mdash;demand the full consideration of enteric fever,
endocarditis, and pneumonia. Thus, in a case recently under my care
at the hospital, and in which I had the benefit of the wide experience
of my Aural colleague, Mr. West, operative procedures were carried
out on the mastoid region, the patient dying some days later from
enteric fever. Again, the question of differential diagnosis between
tuberculous meningitis, brain tumour and brain abscess is always
cropping up. Thus, a short time ago, I explored both temporo-sphenoidal
lobes in a boy suffering from double otitis media and
presenting well-marked general cerebral symptoms, only to find that
he was a subject of tuberculous meningitis.</p>

<p>The diagnosis is often difficult, and no trouble must be spared
in the complete investigation of the case. <i>Lumbar puncture</i> should
invariably be carried out, the fluid being examined both cytologically
and bacteriologically. In all cases of doubt one would be wise to
call in further advice before undertaking exploratory operation.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Cavernous sinus thrombosis.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Thrombosis of the cavernous
sinus arises either as an osteo-phlebitis or as a thrombo-phlebitis.
In the former case, the thrombus is dependent on disease of the bones
related to the sinus&mdash;arising more especially as the result of prolonged
sphenoidal sinusitis&mdash;whilst, in the latter instance, the sinus becomes
infected through one of the many vascular communications connecting
it with other neighbouring regions. Thus the radicles of the ophthalmic
vein, by means of their communication with orbital, ethmoidal, and
upper nasal vessels, and their connexion at the inner canthus of the
eye with radicles of the angular vein, afford the most ready means of
infection. Again, infection may spread from the auditory region along
the superior petrosal sinus, and from the tonsillar and pharyngeal
regions along the various emissary veins connecting the cavernous sinus
on the one hand with the deep cervical vascular system on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span></p>

<p>The two cavernous sinuses intercommunicate by means of the
circular sinus, and consequently thrombosis of the one sinus is liable
to involve its fellow. According to Macewen,<a id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> bilateral trouble occurs
in 50 per cent. cases, the infection often spreading from one sinus
to the other within twenty-four to thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>Thrombosis of the cavernous sinus is often associated with
meningeal infection or brain-abscess.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h5>

<h6 class="inline following">(<i>a</i>) <i>Symptoms dependent on the formation of
the thrombus and its extension to neighbouring venous and lymphatic
channels.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">The presence of the thrombus and its extension into
ophthalmic, angular, and retinal veins leads to proptosis, paresis of
the ocular muscles, disturbances of vision, and &#339;dema. <i>Proptosis</i> is
of rapid development, frequently reaching its maximum within a few
hours, the globe being protruded in the downward and outward direction.
With respect to <i>ocular palsies</i>, the movements of the globe are greatly
restricted with squints, ptosis, and perhaps complete ophthalmoplegia.
The pupil may be contracted during the earlier stages, becoming fully
dilated and insensitive at a later date. The <i>vision</i> suffers in proportion
to the degree of paralysis of ocular muscles and associated retinal
h&aelig;morrhages and thrombosis. The veins of the lids, conjunctiv&aelig;,
and upper part of the face and forehead are engorged, with corresponding
&#339;dema of the soft parts. The conjunctiv&aelig; may be chemotic.</p>

<p>The spread of the thrombus to the opposite sinus results in the
development of bilateral symptoms, whilst the involvement of the
petrosal sinus may bring about thrombosis of the lateral and sigmoid
sinuses, with corresponding developments.</p>

<p>In other cases the meningeal veins are affected at an early date,
in which case the symptoms dependent on the cavernous thrombus
are obscured by those resulting from the meningeal infection.</p>

<h6 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <i>Symptoms dependent on toxic absorption or resulting from the
transference of infected particles to other parts of the body.</i></h6>

<p class="hinline">These more
general symptoms closely resemble those enumerated when discussing
lateral sinus thrombosis (see <a href="#Page283">p. 283</a>). Headache, however, is of the
most intense type, and pain, of a severe neuralgic character, is referred
along the course and distribution of the first and second divisions of
the fifth nerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">It has been suggested that exploration could be
carried out, the thrombus evacuated, and the cavernous sinus region
drained from the naso-ethmoidal region or by approach along the
floor of the middle fossa of the skull&mdash;an exaggerated Gasserian
ganglion operation. Both these methods have been tried, but the
difficulties encountered and the want of success tended to show that
cavernous sinus thrombosis was beyond the reach of the surgeon.
However, of recent date, more hopeful views have been entertained,
it being suggested that the globe should be removed, the
sinus explored, and the orbital cavity packed with gauze. It is
doubtful, however, whether the end justifies the means.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The prognosis in brain abscess, meningitis, and sinus
thrombosis.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">A patient may be expected to recover from <i>brain
abscess</i>, whether temporo-sphenoidal, cerebellar, or frontal, if an early
diagnosis be made, if the case be uncomplicated by meningeal infection
or sinus thrombosis, and if the evacuation be carried out without
any great difficulty. As Sir William Macewen<a id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> pointed out, &#8216;an
uncomplicated brain abscess may be regarded as the most hopeful
of all cerebral affections.&#8217; In fatal cases, death results from general
meningeal infection or from the bursting of the abscess into the lateral
ventricles.</p>

<p>In <i>meningitis</i> the prognosis is bad, more especially when the
process is widespread. Early exposure of the affected region and the
supply of adequate drainage offer the only hope of recovery. This,
even under the most favourable circumstances, is a desperate remedy.</p>

<p>The prognosis in <i>lateral sinus thrombosis</i> hinges to a large extent
on the time at which operative procedures are carried out. When
the case is seen and operated on at an early date in the history of
the disease, recovery may be anticipated in about 50 per cent. cases.
Hunter Tod states that, when all cases are considered of whatever
grade, about one-third recover. Death results from py&aelig;mia, septic&aelig;mia,
meningitis, or brain abscess.</p>

<p><i>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</i> of the infective variety almost
necessarily terminates fatally. Death results from causes similar
to those observed in cases of lateral sinus thrombosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span></p>

<h3>HERNIA CEREBRI</h3>

<p>The term Hernia cerebri was formerly used as inclusive of all
those conditions in which the brain protruded through some aperture
in the skull, whether such opening was congenital, traumatic, or
post-operative.</p>

<p>Owing to the recent advances in cranio-cerebral surgery, especially
with reference to the frequent adoption of decompression operations,
it is advisable that the cases should be classified into two <span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>1. Cases of hernial protrusion</b>, including cephaloceles (see
<a href="#Page1">Chapter I</a>), protrusions intentionally produced by the surgeon in a
decompression operation, and those which follow after unsuccessful
operations for tumour removal. It will be observed that, in all
these cases, the projecting brain, though bulging through its osseous
barrier, is still protected by a more or less normal scalp-covering.</p>

<p><b>2. Cases of hernia cerebri.</b> Here, as the result of injury to
scalp, bone, dura, and brain, the cerebral substance bulges through
a deficiency in the vault and presents on the surface, uncovered by
integument. Hernia cerebri <i>can</i> develop under non-infective conditions,
the congested state of the bruised or lacerated brain bringing
about that degree of intracranial tension which can only be relieved
by the outward projection of the brain. Still it must be accepted
that Hernia cerebri almost invariably implies some bacterial infection.</p>

<p><i>Hernial protrusions</i> are dealt with elsewhere. <i>Hernia cerebri</i>
requires some consideration. Its development, by reason of its usual
bacterial agency, must always be regarded as of serious import. The
congested brain bulges through the aperture in the skull and presents
on the surface as a purple&mdash;sometimes black&mdash;fungating mass, bleeding
freely, and associated with a considerable discharge of cerebro-spinal
fluid, serum, and pus.</p>

<p>The effects produced by this condition vary according to the
extent of the cerebritis, and the question of associated meningeal
infection.</p>

<p>When associated with meningitis those symptoms which might
result from the hernial protrusion are more or less obscured by those
dependent on the meningeal infection. Under other circumstances,
the symptoms vary according to the extent and position of the area<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
involved. Thus, when the infection is limited to the surface of the
brain in the immediate vicinity of the aperture in the bone, the patient
may merely complain of some headache and present some symptoms
of cerebral irritation. More usually, the infection spreads rapidly
to the surrounding brain substance, and the patient evidences the
most acute stage of cerebral irritation, passing thence rapidly into
a stuporose, typhoid-like condition.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">With the object of reducing the infectivity of the
protruding brain, fomentations have been advocated. From my own
experience, however, it would appear that their application tends to
increase the degree of protrusion, and that better results may be
obtained by keeping the exposed brain as dry as possible, painting
over with a 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. solution of iodine in rectified spirit,
dusting<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
with antiseptic powder, and protecting with dry dressings, frequently
replaced.</p>

<p>In the event of failure to improve the condition by means of
these minor remedies&mdash;a too-frequent occurrence&mdash;excision of the
protruding mass may be regarded as a perfectly justifiable procedure,
providing that the hernia does not include the cerebellum or motor
cortical region. The protrusion is shaved away flush with the level
of the skull, the raw surface of the brain lightly painted with iodine,
dusted with iodoform or other antiseptic powder, and protected with
gauze and wool.</p>

<p>The prognosis is necessarily most grave, but the most astounding
recoveries have taken place under this mode of treatment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="chapname">BULLET-WOUNDS OF THE SKULL AND BRAIN</span></h2>

<p>In the consideration of bullet-wounds of the skull and brain the
following factors must be taken into <span class="nowrap">account:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The velocity of the bullet.</p>

<p>The distance at which the bullet is fired.</p>

<p>The size of the bullet.</p>

<p>The nature of the bullet.</p>

<p>The angle of impact.</p>

<p>The position of the bullet at the moment of impact.</p>

<p>Before, however, noting the varying effects on the skull as
produced by one or more of these factors, it will be necessary to
allude briefly to the average effect on the skull as produced by bullet-wounds
in general.</p>

<p>&#8216;When a foreign body passes through any part of the skull&mdash;it
matters not what the direction may be&mdash;the aperture of exit is always
greater than the aperture of entry.&#8217; Such was the law enunciated
by Teevan in 1864. The explanation is as follows: &#8216;The aperture
of entry is caused by the penetrating body only, whilst the aperture
of exit is larger, insomuch as it is made by the penetrating body
plus the fragments of bone driven out of the proximal table and
diploe.&#8217; It might also be added that the greater degree of damage
will always be incurred by the unsupported table&mdash;the internal at
the wound of entry, the external at that of exit.</p>

<p>The size and shape of the aperture of entry through the external
table bears a close resemblance to the size and shape of the entering
bullet. As a general rule, it is round or oval, and presents clean-cut
edges with some small radiating fissures. The aperture of entry
through the internal table is larger, the margins inverted towards
the brain, the radiating fissures more pronounced, and small fragments
of bone in-driven towards the brain.</p>

<p>In the event of perforation of the skull through the medium of<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
a high-velocity bullet, the aperture of exit through the internal table
closely resembles that through the external table at the site of entry,
with the exception that it is influenced by any changes in position
that the bullet may have undergone during its transmission through
the brain. The wound of exit through the external table is again
greater than that through the internal&mdash;in accordance with Teevan&#8217;s
law&mdash;the margins everted, the surrounding bone fissured or comminuted,
whilst fragments of bone may be driven out beneath the
lacerated scalp, or even blown completely away. On the other hand,
when the bullet is fired at close range, the aperture of exit is often
considerably larger than that of entry&mdash;due, in all probability, to
superadded explosive effect.</p>

<p>The effect of the <i>velocity</i> of the bullet on the fracture:&mdash;The greater
the velocity of the bullet the greater the resemblance of the wounds
of entry and exit to the size and shape of the bullet, the &#8216;cleaner&#8217;
the holes, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The effect of <i>distance</i>:&mdash;When the bullet is fired from a distance,
but with full effect, the hole is clean cut and presents the characteristics
enumerated above. When the bullet is &#8216;spent&#8217;, the osseous
injury at the point of impact is usually of a more extensive character
than when the bullet possesses a higher degree of velocity. When
fired at close quarters the damage incurred from the impact of the
bullet is increased by the force of the forwardly driven air and gas.
The skull suffers proportionately, the scalp being severely lacerated,
burnt, and circumferentially ingrained with powder, the bone extensively
comminuted, and the brain severely lacerated.</p>

<p>The effect of <i>size and shape</i> of the bullet:&mdash;The effects produced
on the skull in relation to the size and shapes of the bullet are so
obvious as to require no description. The nature of the bullet must
also be taken into consideration, whether of the soft-nosed variety,
expansile, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The effect of the <i>angle of impact</i>:&mdash;The lesion produced by the
bullet varies according as to whether the bullet glances across the
vault or strikes the bone at right angles. In the former case a &#8216;gutter&#8217;
fracture may result, varying in degree and associated brain complication
according to the angle of impact. In the latter case the
skull is penetrated or perforated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span></p>

<p>The effect of the <i>position of the bullet</i> at the moment of impact:&mdash;The
bullet, at the moment of impact, may be so changed in position&mdash;head-over-heels,
ricochet, &amp;c.&mdash;that the skull may be struck by
its long axis instead of by its nose. In such cases, the wound of
entry will be more extensive than under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that many factors require consideration
in estimating the extent of the osseous lesion and the nature of the
complications existent in any given case. Due allowance must also
be paid to other factors entering into the case, more especially in
relation to the weapon used&mdash;pistol, revolver, gun, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Injury to the bone.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The various injuries to bone may be
classified as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Fractures limited to the external table.</p>

<p>Fractures limited to the internal table.</p>

<p>Gutter fractures.</p>

<p>The complete fractures produced by a penetrating wound.</p>

<p>The complete fractures produced by a perforating wound.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures limited to the external table.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Fractures of this
nature are of exceedingly rare occurrence. They are produced by
a bullet which strikes the skull in such an oblique direction that the
scalp and external table are torn away (&#8216;gutter&#8217; fractures), or by
a bullet which, directed against the outer wall of the frontal sinus,
possesses sufficient force to comminute the outer wall of that sinus,
but, from loss of momentum, is incapable of penetrating further.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Fractures limited to the internal table.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">These fractures
are even more rare than those described above. Their occurrence
is probably only possible when the bullet strikes the skull in a
markedly oblique direction, and with greatly diminished velocity&mdash;&#8216;spent&#8217;
bullets. I believe I am correct in stating that only one
instance of this particular variety of fracture was observed in the
South African War. In any case, they are of such infrequent occurrence
that they may be practically disregarded.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Gutter fractures.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">Gutter fractures are almost invariably
dependent on the impact of a glancing bullet. They may be arranged
in three groups, according to the extent of the osseous lesion.</p>

<p>1. Where the external table is blown away, leaving the internal
table exposed, perhaps comminuted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span></p>

<p>2. Where the internal table is driven in the inward direction,
pressing on, irritating, and perhaps lacerating the dura mater.</p>

<p>3. Where the whole thickness of the bone is blown away, leaving
a gaping wound from which brain-matter may protrude.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Injury to the brain.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">Brain lesions vary &#8216;from a single
track with small points of extravasation in neighbouring areas to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
condition of h&aelig;morrhagic pulp, which latter condition is the result of
injury from the projectile associated with bleeding, often extensive,
into neighbouring areas, disintegrating and pulping the brain-substance.
These latter cases are generally fatal, and are accompanied
not infrequently with meningeal and ventricular h&aelig;morrhage&#8217;
(Bowlby).<a id="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The worst degrees of brain-injury arise when the injury is inflicted
at close range, more especially at the site of emergence of a perforating
bullet, the damage to the soft parts being there magnified by the
waves and vibrations set up by the bullet during its passage across
the brain. In many cases also the brain is dashed as a whole against
the opposing osseous barrier (laceration by contre-coup).</p>

<p>The general effects produced on the skull and brain by a perforating
bullet of high velocity are shown in <a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>.</p>

regard to the symptoms arising from bullet-wounds of the skull and
brain, for they closely resemble those previously enumerated in the
chapters dealing with fractures of the skull and injury to the brain.
There are, however, a few special points to which attention should
be directed.</p>

<p>1. External h&aelig;morrhages are seldom profuse.</p>

<p>2. The escape of cerebro-spinal fluid is of infrequent occurrence,
probably due to the fact that the apertures of entry and exit are
blocked up with scalp, fragments of bone, and pulped and swollen
brain.</p>

<p>3. Concussion and irritation are prominent symptoms, compression
is rarely seen in its typical form. As Spencer<a id="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> says, &#8216;The
dominant feature is usually concussion. The extent of the paralysis
depends on the region injured, and there is often at first extensive
temporary paralysis from vibratory concussion of the brain substance
suspending its functions over a wide area around the bullet-track.&#8217;
Cerebral irritation and Jacksonian fits are frequently observed.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Indications for operation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">There is a great uniformity of
opinion with regard to the indications for operation as expressed by
those who have had considerable experience in wounds of this nature.
One has only to glance through the works of recognized
authorities&mdash;Spencer,<a id="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>

Knaggs,<a id="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> &amp;c.&mdash;to see that it is
an accepted rule that all bullet-wounds of the skull and brain call
for early operative interference, it being granted that the condition
of the patient is compatible with such treatment.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The exploration of the wounds of entry and exit.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">Whether the
skull be penetrated or perforated, the wounds are investigated after
similar general principles. After careful shaving and cleansing of the
whole scalp, and after application of the scalp-tourniquet, a scalp-flap
is turned down, the centre corresponding as far as possible to the site
of entrance or emergence of the bullet. The under aspect of the flap
is examined for loose fragments of bone, hair, portions of headgear,
&amp;c. These are removed and the flap cleansed. The bone is next
examined. All loose fragments are removed, both large and small.
The smaller are discarded, the larger are boiled (for ten minutes)<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
and preserved in hot saline solution for replacement at the termination
of the operation, if such a course should be deemed advisable
(see <a href="#Page132">p. 132</a>). Those fragments of bone which retain their pericranial
attachments are merely elevated and turned aside, to be again placed
in position at the proper time.</p>

<p>Trephining is seldom necessary, the hole in the bone usually
allowing of the application of craniectomy forceps, if any enlargement
should be requisite.</p>

<p>A good view of the dura mater can now be obtained. If that
membrane be merely punctured or incised, the tear must be enlarged
with blunt-pointed scissors so as to allow of complete examination
of the underlying brain. H&aelig;morrhage from meningeal vessels is
controlled by the application of ligatures to all vessels that cross the
line of dural section.</p>

<p>The lacerated brain is <i>gently</i> irrigated with saline solution (at
a temperature between 110&deg; and 115&deg; Fahrenheit), and all blood and
pulped brain matter washed away. The cortex is then lightly
examined with the finger and probe for any fragments of bone that
may be embedded in the brain substance. The removal of such
fragments should be conducted with all possible gentleness. The
surgeon should be satisfied that no foreign body remains. The bullet,
when encountered, is removed. Needless to say, the presence of a
bullet and the existence of in-driven fragments of bone should be
investigated previous to the adoption of operative measures by means
of X-ray photography.</p>

<p>If the brain be penetrated or perforated a drainage tube is introduced
through scalp-flap and dura mater in such a manner that its
distal end lies in relation to the track through the brain or flush with
its lacerated surface. Elsewhere the dura is sewn up (fine catgut
sutures) and the scalp-flap replaced, the drainage tube being anchored
to the scalp with a single suture. The tube should be allowed to
remain <i>in situ</i> for at least forty-eight hours and longer if necessary,
the surgeon being guided by the amount of discharge and by the
general progress of the case. In all cases of doubt the surgeon
should err on the side of leaving the tube in position for a longer
period of time, merely shortening it daily. Premature removal
may lead to disastrous results. There can be no question that<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
ultimate success hinges to a large extent on primary or early healing
of the wound.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>The search for and removal of the bullet.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">In the event of a wound
of entry only, it may be presumed that the bullet is within the skull.
Bullets, however, pursue such unexpected and devious courses within
the skull, and possess such a tendency to gravitate towards the base
of the brain, that no attempt should be made at removal except after
full X-ray investigation, stereoscopic if possible.</p>

<p>To this rule there are two exceptions:&mdash;(1) where the bullet lies
superficial in the brain substance, and (2) where there exists, at the
opposite side of the skull, what may be termed an area of attempted
exit, that is to say, an area of bone elevation and blood extravasation,
suggesting that the bullet has penetrated through the brain and impinged
against the opposite side of the skull. In both these instances
operative measures are not only justifiable but often definitely
indicated. On the other hand, it cannot be urged too forcibly that
hasty and ill-determined explorations usually terminate in failure.
Even under the most promising circumstances it by no means follows
that the bullet will be found at the site of counter-trephining, as it
may have rebounded to some more distant region of the brain,
necessitating an operation conducted over a totally different region.
Thus, in a case recently under my care, the bullet entered at the right
temporal region, penetrated the brain and produced on the left side
of the head a well-defined wound of attempted exit. The bullet,
however, on striking the opposing side of the skull rebounded, and
was subsequently found in the apex of the descending cornu of
the right lateral ventricle. This case affords a good example of the
uncertain course pursued by bullets entering the cranial cavity.</p>

<p>However, in certain cases of emergency and in others of expediency
an immediate search should be made for the bullet. The operation
should be carried out with a light hand and not unduly prolonged.</p>

<p>In order to find and remove the bullet various probes and
extractors have been invented. Perhaps the best of these is Sheen&#8217;s
bullet-forceps, probe, and telephone-detector.</p>

<p>&#8216;The forceps are so constructed that they may be attached
directly to the telephone-detector and used as a combined probe and
forceps, or they may be used in combination with the specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
designed graduated probe attached to the detector in the following
manner: The bullet having been located with the probe, the forceps
are introduced along the probe, the jaws of the forceps being provided
with an oblique groove for this purpose. In both methods of use the
telephone-detector is in uninterrupted contact with the bullet during
extraction, an advantage which much facilitates the operation, and
ensures the least possible damage of tissue. In cases where the forceps
are used as a probe and forceps combined, the connexion attached
to the forceps is composed of silver wire, which can be readily sterilized,
and while of sufficient rigidity to avoid risk of accidental short-circuiting
with the patient&#8217;s body, is flexible enough not to interfere
with the delicacy of manipulation. The telephone-detector is placed
on the head of the operator, and the flat plate on the patient&#8217;s body,
good contact being secured by means of a damp roll of lint, or other
material, moistened with a saturated saline solution.&#8217;</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>&#8216;The probe is introduced, and when a metallic foreign body is
touched a fall of potential occurs, and the telephone buzzes. It is
necessary to point out that no mistakes can be made, as may be the
case with a battery in circuit. In using the &#8220;auto-telephone probe&#8221;
the body constitutes an electrolyte, the plate one pole of a voltaic
circle, the probe the other; on touching a metallic body different
to that of the probe, a difference of potential occurs, and the current
ensuing flows through the telephone and is recorded by the diaphragm
in the usual way.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>If the bullet be not found it should be allowed to remain <i>in situ</i>
till such time shall have elapsed as will enable the surgeon to determine
whether further operative measures are indicated, time being<span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span>
allowed also for skiagraphy and for the evolvement of another plan
of campaign. It is of course a well-known fact that bullets in certain
regions of the brain&mdash;e. g. the frontal lobe&mdash;may exercise but little
effect on the individual. Further measures are also indicated when
the want of cleanliness of the wound and the anatomical situation
of the bullet demand secondary operative procedures. All remote
operations are planned according to the
localizing symptoms, aided by X-ray
photography.</p>

<p>After exploration for and removal
of the bullet an extensive osseous defect
may remain. Opinions differ with respect
to the time at which an attempt should
be made to remedy the deficiency and as
to the operative technique appropriate to
the condition. The nature of the wound
must always be taken into consideration,
for the application of any plate of foreign
material is doomed to failure in the event
of the slightest degree of suppuration. As
a general rule, it may be accepted that
it is advisable to postpone such measures
till after the primary or early healing
of the wound. Further delay, however,
tends to allow of the formation of such
adhesions as will result in the development
of Jacksonian epilepsy, chronic headache,
traumatic insanity, &amp;c. The operative
features requisite to the interposition of plates between the
bone and the scalp, and other measures, are fully detailed in
<a href="#Page182">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>after treatment</i> consists in keeping the patient as quiet as
possible, and the administration of a fluid diet. In some cases,
recurring symptoms pointed to the continued presence of bone
fragments; these were usually indicated by signs of irritation, or
often by local inflammation, in the latter case infection taking the
greatest share in the causation. Such cases needed secondary<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
exploration, and the wonderful success of this operation, even when
the wound was evidently infected, was perhaps one of the most
striking experiences of surgery in general.&#8217; (Makins.)<a id="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Complications.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The more important early complications are
meningitis, hernia cerebri, and brain abscess. For the Symptomatology
and Treatment of these conditions the reader is referred to
<a href="#Page247">Chapter VIII</a>.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Results.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The prognosis in any given case depends on the degree
of bone and brain injury, on the presence or absence of the bullet
in the brain, and on the &#8216;cleanliness&#8217; of the wound. In the American
Civil War 61&middot;2 per cent. of all fractures of the skull terminated
fatally, in the Franco-German War 51&middot;3 per cent., and in the South
African War 33&middot;1 per cent. This decreasing mortality is undoubtedly
dependent on the improved methods of treatment.</p>

<p>When the injury is inflicted at short range the prognosis is
undoubtedly less favourable. &#8216;At short range, the characters of the
wounds, and the severity of the symptoms, rendered the immediate
prognosis uniformly bad, a very great majority of the patients dying,
and that at the end of a few hours or days.&#8217; (Makins.)</p>

<p>The best results were obtained when the injury was received in
the frontal region. The occipital region comes second, and the
cerebellar last. Most injuries near the base of the skull were fatal.
Longitudinal wounds were more serious than transverse. However,
the most surprising recoveries were made, both with and without
operative treatment.</p>

<p>The prognosis with regard to pistol wounds is absolutely bad.
Phelps<a id="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> records the following results in cases that came under his
own observation.</p>

<p>Death occurred at once or within the first hour in 15 cases.</p>

<p>Death occurred within twelve hours in 7 cases.</p>

<p>Death occurred within fifteen hours to forty days in 10 cases.</p>

<p>Recovery in but 8 cases.</p>

<p>The more remote results are exceedingly difficult to determine,
for it is impossible to obtain an accurate account of the subsequent
course of events in all cases. With regard to the question of the after-history,<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
Makins<a id="FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> writes, &#8216;I feel certain that a long roll of secondary
troubles from the contraction of the cicatricial tissue, irritation from
distant remaining bone fragments, as well as mental troubles from
actual brain destruction, await record in the near future.&#8217; In the
experience of the writer, this statement is fully justified. The hospital
surgeon continually meets with cases exemplifying the more remote
effects, varying from slight lesions associated with chronic headache
to others showing considerable deficiency in the vault of the skull
with cortical degeneration.</p>

<p>Some of these cases are still capable of being cured, others are
hopelessly inoperable.</p>

<p>In the consideration of the more remote results, it must be
remembered that the surgeon comes mainly into communication
with those cases which require further treatment. The more favourable
are lost to view. Hence the difficulty in estimating with
certainty the absolute results obtained after lesions of this nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="chapname">TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA</span></h2>

<p>Neuralgia of the fifth or trigeminal nerve is, in its varying
degrees, of frequent occurrence. In its cause, manifestations, and
progress, it offers so wide a field for discussion that the question must
be focussed down by means of some simple form of classification such
as enables one to include the majority of cases that come before one&#8217;s
observation.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes, the following types will be sufficiently
<span class="nowrap">inclusive:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Neuralgia minor.</p>

<p>Neuralgia major.</p>

<p>Hysterical neuralgia.</p>

<h3>NEURALGIA MINOR</h3>

<p>This variety is almost invariably dependent in its development
on some exciting cause. In some cases this cause is readily demonstrated,
in others great difficulty may be experienced before the
source is discovered.</p>

<p>These secondary neuralgias may be regarded as resulting from
the following injuries and diseases.</p>

<p class="hind26">Diseases of the tongue, fauces, and pharynx. For example, the
pain referred to the lingual nerve in epithelioma of the
tongue.</p>

<p class="hind26">Diseases and injuries of the maxill&aelig;. For example, the neuralgia
associated with dental caries.</p>

<p class="hind26">Injuries and diseases of the nose and its accessory cavities. For
example, the infra-orbital pain experienced in empyema of
the antrum.</p>

<p class="hind26">Injuries and diseases of the bones of the skull. For example,
the pain referred along the course of those nerves emerging
through the basal foramina involved in a fracture of the
base of the skull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span></p>

<p class="hind26">Errors of refraction. For example, neuralgia of the supra-orbital
nerve.</p>

<p class="hind26">An&aelig;mia, influenza, alcoholism, Bright&#8217;s disease, cold, worry,
malaria (brow-ague), rheumatism, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But slight allusion need be made to the <i>symptomatology</i> of neuralgia
minor&mdash;the conditions are more or less familiar to every one.
The pain, though usually most intense in that particular branch of
the nerve which is most intimately related to the source of the
neuralgia, is often referred to other branches of the same nerve-trunk,
and sometimes to an entirely different nerve. Thus, in the case of an
epithelioma of the tongue, the pain, though perhaps most acute in
the region supplied by the lingual nerve, is nevertheless frequently
referred to the ear along the course and distribution of the chorda
tympani.</p>

<p>The pain is more or less continuous, often associated with
exacerbations, but seldom paroxysmal. The patient frequently
complains of heat and tenderness over the areas supplied by the nerve
in question and, in almost every instance, there are points of special
tenderness corresponding as a rule to the emergence of the nerve-trunk
through some osseous foramen. Again, some relief may be
obtained by the application of pressure over the site of that foramen.
For example, neuralgia dependent on antral empyema is most
acute in the region of the infra-orbital foramen, and relief may be
experienced by pressure applied over that foramen.</p>

<p>In the event of failure to discover an exciting cause, some
difficulty may be experienced in coming to a correct conclusion as to
whether the case belongs to the minor types of neuralgia, or should
be relegated to the more serious group of neuralgia major (tic
doloreux). In general, however, the neuralgias minor may be
distinguished from the major variety by the following <span class="nowrap">features:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) The presence of some detectable forms of nerve-irritation.
In the neuralgias major there may be no such cause.</p>

<p>(2) The relief of symptoms on the successful treatment of the
cause.</p>

<p>(3) The relative absence of those paroxysmal attacks which are
so typical of neuralgia major.</p>

<p>(4) The infrequence of severe vaso-motor, trophic, and sensory<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
changes in the regions supplied by the nerve affected. Such changes
are more or less constant in neuralgia major.</p>

<p>(5) The wide distribution of the pain and its reference to other
nerves, with no clear line of demarcation from neighbouring areas
supplied by totally different nerves. In neuralgia major the pain,
though often involving both second and third divisions of the fifth
nerve, is referred to the areas supplied by those nerves only, with
a clear line of demarcation from neighbouring regions.</p>

<p>In cases of neuralgia of doubtful origin one can only observe the
effect of treatment and be guided by the results obtained.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">The source of the neuralgia requires primary
consideration. When this has been rectified the patient should be
treated after general medical principles. In the event of failure at
relief, we have two other strings to our bow&mdash;alcohol injections, and
neurectomy of the nerve involved. Alcohol injections are dealt with
later. Neurectomy&mdash;after Thiersch&#8217;s method of avulsion&mdash;is greatly
preferable to all the older methods of neurotomy, nerve-stretching,
and nerve-division. These older methods brought about in their
train but transitory alleviation of pain.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Neurectomy of the inferior dental nerve.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">A transverse
incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the
level of junction between horizontal and vertical rami of the jaw,
extending from the anterior border of the vertical ramus to the posterior
border of the same. The tissues are retracted and the masseter
muscle exposed. The muscle fibres are split in the vertical direction
and the bone laid bare. A <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch trephine is applied, and a disk of
bone removed so as to expose the inferior dental nerve at its entrance
into the inferior dental canal. The nerve is freed from the corresponding
artery, divided at the centre of exposure, and the two ends
seized with forceps, twisted and avulsed in such a manner as to destroy
and remove the maximum number of nerve-fibres. The disk of bone
is replaced, the muscle fibres brought together with a few catgut
sutures, and the margins of the skin incision approximated.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Exposure of the infra-orbital nerve.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">A curved incision is
made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues parallel to and
below the infra-orbital margin, the tissues retracted, and the small
muscles overlying the infra-orbital foramen divided or retracted so<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
as to allow exposure of the foramen. The nerve is isolated and
divided. The peripheral end is seized with forceps and avulsed.
The central end may be treated after similar fashion, or, preferably,
again exposed in the infra-orbital groove or canal, the tissues being
peeled away from the floor of the orbit and the nerve sought for as
it traverses the infra-orbital canal. With this object in view, it may
be necessary to gently break away the osseous roof of the canal
before the nerve can be exposed. It is then lifted up with a small
hook, drawn through the infra-orbital foramen, seized with forceps,
and avulsed in such a manner as to be torn away somewhere in the
region of the spheno-maxillary fossa. The wound is then sewn up.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Exposure of the supra-orbital nerve.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The nerve is exposed
through a curved incision parallel to the supra-orbital margin,
and so planned as to be concealed by the eyebrow. The fibres of the
orbicularis palpebrarum are separated and the foramen identified.
The nerve is separated from its artery, divided, the peripheral portion
avulsed, and the central portion again exposed as it courses along
the roof of the orbit. For this purpose the tissues of the upper lid
are detached from the supra-orbital margin, the nerve delivered with
the aid of a small hook, brought out through the foramen, and avulsed
in such a manner as to be torn away somewhere in the region of the
sphenoidal fissure. The wound is then sewn up.</p>

<h3>NEURALGIA MAJOR</h3>

<p>Neuralgia major originates most commonly in the third division
of the nerve, less frequently in the second, and rarely in the first.
Whichever division be primarily affected, there is a very general
tendency for other branches to become involved, and this in a very
definite way&mdash;the pain spreading centrally from the nerve first involved,
radiating to other nerve-trunks so soon as they shall be
reached. Thus, pain originating in the inferior dental branch of the
third division spreads to the lingual and other branches of that division
and then involves the second division. Fortunately, whether the
trouble originates in the third or second divisions, the ophthalmic tends
to escape or to become less seriously involved&mdash;a fortunate circumstance
considering the terrible conditions associated with neuritis of
that nerve, the disastrous results on cornea, conjunctiva, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span></p>

<p>The disease is undoubtedly of a progressive nature, originating
without rhyme or reason. It seldom becomes evident before the ages
of 45 to 55, affecting both rich and poor alike.</p>

<p>Wilfred Harris<a id="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> collected 265 cases, and showed that the disease
was slightly more common in men than in women&mdash;144 to 131.
There appeared to be some predilection for the disease to involve
the right side in preference to the left&mdash;179 to 80. In 6 cases the
affection was bilateral.</p>

<p>Trigeminal neuralgia does not in itself lead to fatal results, but
the continuous pain, the want of sleep, and the difficulty experienced
in taking sufficient nourishment soon reduce the patient to such a
miserable condition that, unless relieved by the surgeon, amelioration
is sought in morphia or release in death.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it will be convenient to enumerate
certain points aiding in the differential diagnosis between the true

<p>The <b>pathology</b> of tic doloreux is most obscure. The parts
requiring examination are the peripheral nerve-trunks, the ganglion,
the sensory root, and the central nervous system. The last two
regions may be excluded, not only on the ground that research has
failed to show any constant structural changes, but also because
the removal of the ganglion may be regarded as curative of the
disease. The ganglion itself and the peripheral nerve-trunks remain
for investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span></p>

<p>In the peripheral nerve-fibres no constant material changes have
been observed. The epineurium, on the other hand, is almost invariably
shrunken and sclerosed. Considerable stress might be laid on
this fact unless it were also taken into consideration that the nerves
were examined in patients who had suffered from major neuralgia
for prolonged periods of time. Similar changes have also been
observed in patients who have never exhibited neuralgic symptoms.</p>

<p>In the ganglion itself the following changes have been observed:&mdash;(1)
arterio-sclerosis; (2) alteration in the character of the nerve-fibres
traversing the ganglion; and (3) adhesions between the ganglion and
the surrounding parts. All these changes, however, are so inconstant
that but little importance can be attached to them.</p>

<p>At the present time there is a disposition to regard trigeminal
neuralgia in the light of an ascending neuritis, originating peripherally
and ascending towards the Gasserian ganglion. Sir Victor Horsley
first pointed out that the ganglion acts as a barrier to the further
upward spread of the affection. This is proved by the success
obtained in the removal of the ganglion.</p>

<h4 class="fullyleft blankbefore75"><b>Symptomatology.</b></h4>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Pain.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The onset of pain may be preceded by premonitory
symptoms such as tinglings, throbbings, and burning sensations in
the parts subsequently involved, whilst, in the earlier stages of the
disease, the pain may be more or less localized to the site of emergence
of the nerve from an osseous foramen.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages also the attacks, though severe, are paroxysmal,
of short duration, perhaps not lasting more than half a minute,
and definitely localized to some special nerve-trunk. During the
periods of remission the patient feels quite well. Gradually the pain
increases in severity, the periods of remission shorten, and the pain
in its distribution becomes more widespread, the neuritis&mdash;or whatever
the process may be&mdash;spreading centrally and radiating along
the course and distribution of such branches of the nerve as shall be
encountered.</p>

<p>Paroxysms are a marked feature, occasionally of so severe a
nature that the patient falls to the ground as if struck by lightning,
recovering after a variable period of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span></p>

<p>In the later stages of the disease the pain may be almost continuous,
and the condition of the patient is truly miserable.</p>

<p>The attacks are often ushered in by the slightest stimulus&mdash;talking,
mastication of food, draughts, emotion, &amp;c.&mdash;and, in order
to avoid the occurrence as far as possible, the patient abstains from
talking, dreads eating, &amp;c. Dribbling from the mouth may be
observed in those cases in which the patient finds some relief in keeping
the mouth open. It is also frequently seen during the height of the
paroxysm. At such stages the patient is collapsed, with feeble pulse,
shallow respiration, the temperature subnormal, and the skin clammy.
The attacks occur both during the day and the night, sleep fails, and
the body nutrition suffers.</p>

<p>The site at which the pain originates can often be fixed by the
patient himself. Occasionally relief may be attained by pressure
applied over some particular part, by heat or by cold, or by some
other method discovered by the patient himself.</p>

<p>The attacks are often accompanied by twitchings of the muscles
supplied by the facial nerve, and, according to some investigators,
by fibrillary twitchings of the muscles of the region affected.</p>

<p>In the later stages, wasting of the muscles may be observed.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>Vaso-motor and trophic changes.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">The skin and mucous membrane
supplied by the nerve involved become hyper&aelig;mic and hyper&aelig;sthetic,
and, in the more chronic cases, these changes may be associated
with &#339;dema of the subcutaneous tissues&mdash;the clinical picture
now closely resembling that observed in some cases of angio-neurotic
&#339;dema.</p>

<p>Other symptoms of similar nature are herpes, increased
salivation, furred tongue (on the side of the lesion), sweating of the
skin, lacrimation, conjunctivitis, and keratitis.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><i>General decline in health.</i></h5>

<p class="hinline">This depends, not only on the difficulty
experienced in taking sufficient nourishment, but also on the moral
effect produced by the more or less continuous pain. In the more
severe cases emaciation is rapid.</p>

<h4 class="fullyleft blankbefore75"><b>Treatment.</b></h4>

<p>1. <i>Therapeutic remedies.</i> The following drugs have been recommended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span></p>

<p>Quinine, in large and increasing doses.</p>

<p>Arsenic, given in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>Gelsemium, in toxic doses, every few hours until tinglings in the
fingers and nausea show that the drug has been pushed far enough
(Sir Victor Horsley).</p>

<p>Methylene blue, in three-grain doses (Sir Watson Cheyne).</p>

<p>Iron, antipyrin, strychnine, cannabis indica, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Morphia. This drug is undoubtedly beneficial in its results, but
the habitual use thereof is strongly contra-indicated, not only because
of the temporary benefit received, but also because of the necessary
increase in the quantity required to alleviate the pain. If persistently
used the patient gradually develops the morphia habit.</p>

<p>Some of these remedies suffice for the neuralgias minor, but with
regard to their action in cases of neuralgia major, their effect may be
summed up as follows: &#8216;True tic doloreux has been the therapeutic
despair of most physicians and surgeons,&#8217;<a id="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and &#8216;too often the
operation is put off till the patient is addicted to the morphia habit,
depleted in strength and vitality by drugs, sleepless nights, and years
of intense suffering&#8217;.<a id="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Until quite recently, with the exception of these medicinal
remedies, the only other methods at our disposal in the treatment
of trigeminal neuralgia were Gasserian ganglion removal and other
intracranial operations on the three divisions of the fifth nerve. In
1906, however, Schl&ouml;sser<a id="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of Munich advocated the injection of
alcohol into the region of those foramina at the base of the skull
through which the nerve trunks emerged. As the result of these
injections it was stated that, although some slight degree of cutaneous
an&aelig;sthesia frequently resulted, yet that it was usually of an unimportant
and transient character, and that the pain subsided and
finally ceased, remaining absent for a variable period of time, usually
about ten months. In the event of recurrence the injection was
repeated, each period of recurrent pain being less intense and less
prolonged, whilst the periods of remission increased proportionately.</p>

<p>Whilst it is clear from the results obtained by those who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
followed in Schl&ouml;sser&#8217;s footsteps, that alcohol injections are, as a rule,
reasonably satisfactory, yet it must be clearly understood that
beneficial results are not always observed, and that in the event of
failure the more radical intracranial operations must be carried out.</p>

<h6 class="fullyleft blankbefore75"><b>The technique of alcohol injections.</b></h6>

<p><i>Question of an&aelig;sthetic.</i> Freezing of the skin or other method of
local an&aelig;sthesia suffices to allow of the painless introduction of the
needle. A general an&aelig;sthetic should be avoided wherever possible,
as the burning sensation experienced by the patient when the nerve-trunk
is encountered greatly assists the accuracy of introduction.</p>

<p><i>The needle.</i> The needle should be stout&mdash;10 cm. long, 1&middot;5 cm.
in diameter, and graduated in centimetres up to 5 cm., and provided
with a blunt stilette.</p>

<p><i>Introduction.</i> The skin is cleansed, the stilette slightly withdrawn,
and the needle introduced. After puncture of the skin the
stilette is pushed home, all further introduction being carried out
with the blunt advancing point. When in position, the stilette is
withdrawn, and a glass syringe, ready filled with alcohol, fitted to
the needle and the injection made.</p>

<p><i>The solution.</i> Purves Stewart recommends the injection of
1-1&middot;5 c.cm. of the following <span class="nowrap">solution:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="centerblock">

<p class="noindent blankbefore75">Beta eucaine, 2 grains<br />
Absolute alcohol, 6 drs.<br />
Distilled water to the ounce.</p>

</div><!--centerblock-->

<p class="noindent blankbefore75">Wilfred Harris advises 90 per cent. alcohol, preceded by a 2 per cent.
solution eucaine. He urges that two or three drops should be injected
slowly, and if the needle be correctly placed a sharp burning pain will
instantly be felt over the area of the distribution of the nerve, lasting
fifteen seconds or so and then dying away. Two or three more drops
are then injected, and thus &#8216;a few drops at a time, from 1 to 1&middot;5 c.cm.
are injected, the pain produced with each succeeding push of the
syringe being less and less&#8217;.</p>

<p>To reach the <i>foramen ovale</i> (third division), the needle is introduced
through the cheek behind the last molar tooth, at the lower
border of the zygoma, at a point 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cm. in front of the descending
root of the zygoma. The blunt needle penetrates the masseter muscle<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
and the posterior part of the temporal muscle. It is then directed
backwards and slightly upwards till it impinges on the skull at the
external pterygoid plate. It is then pushed on, upwards and backwards,
till it enters the foramen ovale at a depth usually of about
4 cm. from the zygoma. In case of difficulty in passing the needle
through the sigmoid notch of the jaw the mouth should be widely
opened.</p>

<p>If the needle be directed too low it may penetrate the pharyngeal
wall or the Eustachian tube; if too far back, the middle meningeal
artery.</p>

<p>To reach the <i>foramen rotundum</i> (second division)&mdash;a rather more
difficult procedure&mdash;it is necessary to find the posterior border of the
orbital process of the malar bone, prolonging this line downwards
to the lower border of the zygoma and inserting the needle <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cm.
posterior to this point. The needle is pushed horizontally inwards
and the point directed slightly upwards, the foramen being reached
in the pterygo-maxillary fossa at a depth of about 3 cm. from the
zygoma. The needle, for an average-sized skull, should never penetrate
deeper than 5 cm. The structures pierced are the anterior
fibres of the masseter and the buccinator muscles. If directed too
horizontally, the needle will pass below the nerve and reach the
spheno-palatine region; if too high, the sphenoidal fissure may be
reached and the branches of the third nerve damaged, causing
diplopia and dilatation of the pupil.</p>

<p>To reach the <i>sphenoidal fissure</i> (first division), the needle is
introduced at the outer margin of the orbit, close within the fronto-malar
articulation, and passed along the outer wall of the orbit to
a depth of 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 4 cm.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it is essential that these injections to the basal
foramina should only be carried out in the first instance after experimentation
on the cadaver.</p>

<p>In each case a single injection may suffice, but as a general rule
it is advisable to repeat the process after two or three days, and again
at longer intervals. It is not necessary that the nerve-trunks should
be pierced, but better results are obtained by so doing. The surface
area to which the particular nerve-trunk is distributed immediately
becomes an&aelig;sthetic, remaining in that state till the effect of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span>
injection shall have passed off. The masticatory muscles are
paralysed. The injection may be followed by paresis of the facial
muscles, by &#339;dema of the lower lid, and by h&aelig;matomata. These
last-named results are, however, transitory.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Results.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Schl&ouml;sser, who injects 15 to 20 minims of an 80 per
cent. solution of alcohol, reported in 1907 that he had treated 123
cases, the average period of relief from pain being ten and a half
months.</p>

<p>Wilfred Harris<a id="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> reported on 38 cases, 31 of which were completely
relieved for periods varying from two to eleven months. In a more
recent communication he reports on 86 cases, in only 3 of which was
no relief obtained. In 7 cases the injection was made into the ganglion
itself, in anticipation of more permanent results.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Operative procedures.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Intracranial procedures for trigeminal
neuralgia were formerly associated with so high a rate of mortality
that they were not regarded with favour. Of recent years, however,
as the result of the general improvement in technique, it has been
clearly demonstrated that, in experienced hands, &#8216;the ganglion can
be readily exposed, h&aelig;morrhage and shock need no longer be considered
elements of danger: the risks of the operation are only those
associated with every major operation. Recovery from the effects
of the operation is rapid; the patients are frequently up and about
on the third or fourth day, and the ultimate results are, to say the
least, most gratifying to the patient and to the operator.&#8217;<a id="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The following operations require <span class="nowrap">consideration:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Intracranial resection of the second and third divisions of
the fifth nerve (Abb&eacute;&#8217;s operation).</p>

<p>2. Operations for the removal of the whole or part of the
Gasserian ganglion (Hartley-Krause operation and its modifications).</p>

<p>3. Operations on the sensory root of the ganglion (Frazier&#8217;s
operation).</p>

<p><i>Intracranial resection of the second and third divisions of the fifth
nerve and operations on the ganglion itself</i> resemble one another so
closely in their preliminary operative stages that they may be considered
together. After the usual preparatory treatment&mdash;in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
the shaving process may be confined to the temporal region&mdash;the
incision, commencing well above and behind the external angular
frontal process, passes backwards below the level of the temporal
crest and terminates immediately in front of the tragus of the ear.
The front part of the incision, as depicted in <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>, is prolonged
too far downwards. It should not be carried further forward than
the anterior margin of the hairy scalp, any further downward prolongation
tending to involve that branch of the facial nerve which is
distributed to the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle.</p>

<p>The incision, carried out methodically, first involves the skin
only, pressure being applied by the surgeon on the one side and his
assistant on the other, so as to control bleeding. All divided vessels
are at once clamped. The operation may be a prolonged one, and in
its later stages bleeding from meningeal vessels and emissary veins
may not be so readily controlled. It is essential, therefore, that the
earlier stages should be as bloodless as possible.</p>

portions = parts removed in intracranial resection of the second and third divisions
of the nerve (<i>Abb&eacute;&#8217;s operation</i>).</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The temporal fascia is next incised&mdash;slightly below the line of
the skin incision. Finally, the temporal muscle is divided&mdash;again
at a lower level than the fascial incision. Skin, fascia, and muscle
are then turned down to a zygomatic base. Some surgeons split
the temporal muscle in the direction of its fibres, a course, however,
that tends somewhat to cramp the operative field.</p>

<p>The trephine is applied to the bone, the surgeon aiming at striking
the angle between the anterior and posterior branches of the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
meningeal artery. The bone-disk is removed. With the aid of
craniectomy forceps the bone is nibbled away, more especially in the
downward direction towards the base of the skull. It is essential
that the operator should get down as low as possible, for the lower
the line of attack the easier the approach to the ganglion and the
less the damage incurred by the brain (from retraction).</p>

<p>The opening in the bone, oval in shape, should present a diameter
in the vertical direction of about 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches, and an antero-posterior
diameter of about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches.</p>

<p>The dura is stripped away from the base of the skull, partly with
the fingers and partly with the blunt dissector, and a flat, slightly
malleable retractor introduced along the floor of the middle fossa,
the dura and overlying temporo-sphenoidal lobe being gently lifted
upwards. The surgeon should take upon himself the responsibility
of retracting the brain, holding that instrument with the one hand
and working inwards with the other, directing his course towards
the foramen spinosum (middle meningeal) and foramen ovale (third
division of the fifth nerve).</p>

<p>During this stage h&aelig;morrhage, derived mainly from the branches
of the middle meningeal, is often troublesome. It may be controlled
by the insertion of dry or wet gauze&mdash;in the latter case the gauze
is soaked in saline solution or sterilized water (at a temperature
of about 110&deg; Fahrenheit)&mdash;or by the introduction of cotton-wool
plugs to each of which a silk thread is attached, for the purpose of
facilitating their final removal.</p>

<p>The middle meningeal artery acts as a guide to the foramen
spinosum, a foramen that lies immediately posterior and external to
the foramen ovale. In many cases the position of this artery so
hampers the operator in his manipulation that ligature is demanded.
For this purpose Cushing&#8217;s silver &#8216;clips&#8217; will be found most serviceable.
One clip is applied to the artery immediately after its entry into the
skull, the other a short distance above, the vessel being divided
between the two (see <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The foramen ovale is then identified, the dura being stripped
away from the nerve trunk by blunt dissection. The surgeon then
works inwards and forwards to the second division of the nerve and
its foramen, the foramen rotundum. H&aelig;morrhage, in this case<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
derived from emissary veins, may again be troublesome. Considerable
perseverance is required, and, although each attempt at further
separation of the dura from the bone entails more oozing, the difficulties&mdash;except
in the most exceptional cases&mdash;may be overcome.</p>

<p>The <i>second and third divisions may now be resected</i>. For this
purpose it is essential that the two nerves should be exposed from the
point of their exit from the skull right up to the margin of the ganglion.
Their dural coat seldom requires to be incised with the knife, the membrane
being readily stripped away with the blunt dissector. When
fully exposed, the nerve trunks are picked up with a blunt aneurysm
needle and divided in two places, flush with the basal foramina and
close up against the ganglion. The intermediate parts are removed.</p>

<p>To prevent regeneration of nerve fibres&mdash;with consequent return
of symptoms&mdash;the basal foramina are blocked up with small ivory
pegs&mdash;well driven home&mdash;or with amalgam.</p>

<p>All gauze plugs are removed, the field of operation well dried,
and dura and brain allowed to fall back into position. The wound
is closed, if possible without drainage. In the event of considerable
oozing a cigarette drain should be inserted for twenty-four hours. The
scalp-flap is sewn up, skin, muscle, and fascia being united separately.</p>

<p><i>Removal of the Gasserian ganglion.</i> There is some divergence of
opinion as to whether it is necessary to remove the ganglion entire
or whether it suffices to resect the lower two-thirds&mdash;that part
through which the fibres of the second and third divisions course&mdash;the
upper third being left intact. This latter course is advocated
by Jonathan Hutchinson on the grounds that (1) the first division
is but rarely involved in the neuralgic process, (2) its inclusion in
the process of removal entails some risk to the eye&mdash;conjunctivitis,
keratitis, and sloughing of the cornea, and (3) resection of the lower
two-thirds of the ganglion, when carried out in suitable cases, is but
rarely followed by the development of neuralgia in the first or
ophthalmic trunk. Added to these facts, it must be admitted
that the complete removal of the ganglion is associated with added
operative risk&mdash;wounding of the cavernous sinus and injury to the
third, fourth, and sixth nerves.</p>

<p>The Gasserian ganglion lies in the cavum Meckelii, a depression
on the anterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
and is situated between the two layers of dura mater, the stronger
on the upper or cerebral side, the weaker between it and the bone.
Under the pathological conditions often existent in cases of trigeminal
neuralgia, considerable adhesion may be present between the ganglion
and its enveloping coats. Consequently, its complete exposure is often
a matter of considerable difficulty. The dura must be stripped away
from the outer aspect of the ganglion, firstly by dividing the membrane
along the border of the ganglion between the site of emergence
of the second and third divisions, and then by blunt dissection.</p>

<p>The ganglion and its efferent branches being exposed, <i>resection
of the lower two-thirds</i> may be carried out. The second and third
nerve trunks are severed flush with the basal foramina, traction
applied, and the lower portion of the ganglion resected.</p>

<p>During the final stages, the manipulations of the operator are
again likely to be obscured by venous oozing and by the discharge
of some cerebro-spinal fluid. Patience, careful application of gauze
plugs, and good illumination of the field of operation are required
to overcome these difficulties. In some few cases the bleeding has
been so profuse that the operation has had to be abandoned for the
time being, a fresh attempt being made some days later. This course
should, however, rarely be necessary.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the operator should deem it necessary to remove
the whole ganglion, this procedure may now be carried out. The
posterior part of the ganglion is exposed, together with its sensory
root. This root is hooked forward with a small blunt-pointed hook
and then divided. Traction is applied to the ganglion and it is
turned forwards, the three terminal divisions being divided one after
the other with the minimum risk of injuring the cavernous sinus.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Modifications of the Hartley-Krause operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">With
the object of obtaining further manipulative room, some surgeons
recommend the formation of an osteoplastic flap. This method
should never be adopted. It is quite unnecessary, it prolongs the
operation, and entails more deformity. Others advise division of the
zygoma, both in front and behind, with downward displacement
of the intermediate portion. Burghard<a id="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> recommends division and
downward displacement of the zygoma together with section of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
coronoid process, this process being turned upwards together with
its attached temporal muscle.</p>

<p>From my own experience, I should regard all these modifications
as quite unnecessary, the Hartley-Krause operation permitting an
adequate operative field. The deformity resulting from all these
more extensive procedures must also be taken into consideration.
The lines of incision in the Hartley-Krause operation are more or less
concealed by the hairy scalp.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Operations on the sensory root (Frazier&#8217;s operation).</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">Charles Frazier advocates the &#8216;physiologic extirpation&#8217; of the
sensory root of the ganglion. The advantages claimed over other
methods are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Control of h&aelig;morrhage and avoidance of risk of injury to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span>
cavernous sinus</i>. The ganglion receives its main blood-supply from
below. Division of the sensory root leaves the base of the ganglion
undisturbed, and this cause of free bleeding is removed. With respect
to the cavernous sinus, the operation is confined to the root of the
ganglion and consequently the sinus is in no wise concerned.</p>

<p>2. <i>Simple technique.</i> The operation of division of the sensory
root is complete before the difficulties common to extraction of the
ganglion have commenced.</p>

<p>3. <i>Avoidance of injury to adjacent structures.</i> The cavernous
sinus is not touched; the sixth nerve, which is intimately related to
the ophthalmic branch, is not exposed; and the motor-fibres which,
passing beneath the ganglion, join the third division outside the skull,
and which are almost necessarily injured in the ganglionic operation,
may, in division of the sensory root, escape implication.</p>

<p>4. <i>Reduction in the rate of mortality.</i> The operation is said to
be more economical of time, to entail less h&aelig;morrhage, and therefore
to be less dangerous.</p>

<p>5. <i>Absence of ocular changes.</i> After division of the sensory root
ocular changes are absent, due in part to the fact that the ocular
nerves are left intact, and also to the probability that &#8216;sympathetic
fibres pass to the eye after entering the trigeminal nerve through the
Gasserian ganglion&#8217; (Spiller).</p>

<p>In the consideration of these advantages it should be noted
that they are mainly directed against procedures in which complete
extirpation of the ganglion is attempted, and are of less weight when
contrasted with the partial excision advocated by Hutchinson.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Frazier&#8217;s operation<a id="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
on the sensory root.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">&#8216;A horse-shoe
shaped incision is made, beginning at the middle of the zygoma and
terminating a little below the apex of the lobe of the ear (see <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>).
The musculo-cutaneous flap is made purposely a little larger than the
opening in the skull. An opening is made in the skull with a diameter
not exceeding 3 cm. and extending down as far as the infra-temporal
crest. The dura is separated from the base of the skull with a blunt
retractor as far as the foramen spinosum. The middle meningeal
artery is ligatured and the dura mater incised directly over the third
division at the margin of the foramen ovale and separated from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>
upper surface of the ganglion as far back as the sensory root. The
latter is picked up with a blunt hook, grasped with forceps and
divided or avulsed. It is necessary only to expose the posterior
portion of the ganglion; the second and third divisions of the fifth,
the structures on the inner side of the ganglion, and the cavernous
sinus, are left undisturbed.&#8217;</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Choice of operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">There are both advantages and disadvantages
to each of the various operations enumerated. There are
also other operations. From my own experience I have come to the
conclusion that the two operations of choice are resection of the second
and third divisions of the fifth nerve and division of the sensory root.
The former of these two operations is carried out when the general
condition of the patient is not altogether satisfactory, presuming,
of course, that the neuralgia is limited to those divisions of the nerve.
Under more favourable circumstances excellent results are obtained
by exposure and division or resection of the sensory root, with,
I think, the minimum risk.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>The results obtained by operation.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">The prevailing impression
that these operations are associated with a high mortality is
totally incorrect. From my own experience and from numerous
recorded cases, the mortality may be estimated at not more than
5 per cent.</p>

<p>The extent of an&aelig;sthesia resulting varies according to the nature
of the operation. Thus, if the upper part of the ganglion be spared
or the operation confined to the second and third divisions, the upper
lid, conjunctiva, cornea, and forehead escape. In any case, taste
is but little impaired, the posterior part of the tongue being supplied
by the glossopharyngeal and the tip and sides by the chorda tympani.
In all cases, except perhaps in Frazier&#8217;s operation, the motor fibres
which accompany the third division are almost always divided, with
consequent paralysis of the corresponding masseter, temporal, and
pterygoid muscles. The degree of discomfort and deformity resulting
from such an&aelig;sthesia and paralysis is, however, not very considerable,
and in contrast with the relief from the terrible pain, of very
little import. It is, as Jonathan Hutchinson says, the price which
the patient has to pay for the cure of the neuralgia.</p>

<p>With respect to recurrence of pain, there is every reason to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
that the resection of the sensory root and the complete removal of the
ganglion are never followed by recurrence of pain. With respect to
Jonathan Hutchinson&#8217;s and Abb&eacute;&#8217;s operations, there is some divergence
of opinion. There would appear to be some cases recorded in
which the symptoms have recurred&mdash;often many years later. With
regard to Hutchinson&#8217;s operation I have no personal experience,
but it is stated that in some few cases the pain has recurred in the
first division. I believe, however, that I am correct in stating that
this is denied by Hutchinson from the experience based on his own
cases. As regards Abb&eacute;&#8217;s operation, recurrence may take place if
the basal foramina are not completely occluded, some few nerve
fibres growing through the foramina on either side of the occluding
medium. Such complications have not taken place in the cases in
which I have carried out this operation.</p>

<p>Besides experiencing immediate and complete relief from pain,
the patients sleep well, eat well, and rapidly convalesce. For some
two or three days they may suffer from some headache, presumably
due to the necessary manipulations of the brain, but this, besides
being relieved by drugs, soon passes off. Frequently, the patients
are up and about within a few days.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of the operation, the greatest care must
be taken to protect the eye on the affected side&mdash;the conjunctival
sac is washed out daily with a mild boracic solution and the cornea
guarded from exposure to air and dust by means of a glass covering
fastened round the forehead. This appliance should be worn for
two or three weeks.</p>

<p>The <b>main difficulties and dangers of operation</b> are as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. H&aelig;morrhage (from middle meningeal artery and cavernous
sinus).</p>

<p>2. Infection.</p>

<p>3. Shock.</p>

<p>4. Ocular complications.</p>

<p>5. Later after-results&mdash;insomnia, restlessness, impairment of
memory, aphasia, and hemiplegia&mdash;all of which are dependent either
on rough handling of the brain or lighter handling of an already
diseased brain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="chapname">TUMOURS OF THE SKULL-BONES</span></h2>

<p>In this the last chapter of this work, I originally intended to deal
with tumours of the scalp and skull-bones. With respect to tumours
of the scalp there is, however, but little to say. The various conditions
are well recognized, their pathology is known, and there is in general
but little to relate. Tumours of the skull-bones come under a different
category and require some consideration.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Tumours of the skull-bones.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">The more important of these
tumours are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind46">Osteomata.</p>

<p class="hind46">Sarcomata, primary and traumatic.</p>

<p class="hind46">Secondary sarcomata and carcinomata.</p>

<h4 class="centersmall">OSTEOMATA</h4>

<p>Exostoses of the skull, though by no means of frequent occurrence,
occupy such definite positions that it would appear as if they
were dependent on some local governing cause. They develop most
frequently in the following <span class="nowrap">positions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>At the external angular frontal process.</p>

<p>At the frontal and parietal eminences.</p>

<p>In the region of the frontal sinus.</p>

<p>In the region of the external auditory meatus and mastoid
process.</p>

<p>All pathological museums possess specimens illustrating the
formation of such exostoses, tumours of a like nature in other parts
of the skull being excessively rare.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to arrive at an explanation it would appear
necessary to direct one&#8217;s attention to tumours of a similar nature
occurring in other parts of the body, more especially in the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
bones. There, it is well recognized that their development is dependent
on irregularities of growth in the region of the epiphyseal lines,
regions where activity of growth is long maintained.</p>

<p>On referring again to the skull, similar features appear. For
instance, the frontal bone, besides possessing one primary centre
for the frontal eminence, has secondary centres for the external
angular frontal process, for the trochlear fossa, and for the nasal spine,
and it is highly probable that those exostoses which develop in the
region of the frontal sinus in reality arise from one or other of
the secondary centres situated in that region.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig92">

<img src="images/illo326.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="433" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92. Ivory Exostoses of the Skull.</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Both frontal and parietal eminences are also sites of active and
prolonged ossification, and the tumours there arising are to be
explained on a like hypothesis.</p>

<p>Similar features are to be observed with respect to those bony
tumours which develop in the aural region, the numerous centres of
ossification for the periotic capsule accounting satisfactorily for their
origin.</p>

<p>Whether originating in the region of the frontal sinus or in the
aural area, the tumour naturally develops along the line of least<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
resistance, filling up the frontal sinus and growing into the external
auditory meatus and mastoid antrum.</p>

<p>More rarely, small exostoses develop on the inner aspect of the
skull, chiefly from the frontal bone in the region of the crista galli.
In some cases the inner aspect of the skull is studded with small
bony tumours, more especially along the line of the superior longitudinal
venous sinus.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig93">

<img src="images/illo327.png" alt="" width="500" height="458" />

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93. The Development of the Frontal Bone.</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, Metopic suture; <span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>,
Primary centre for frontal eminence; <span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>, Secondary centre for external angular
frontal process; <span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>, Secondary centre for trochlear fossa;
<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span>, Secondary centre for
nasal spine.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>These internal exostoses seldom give rise to pressure symptoms,
although, according to Wilks and Moxon,<a id="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> they may push inwards
the dura mater and even lead to idiocy and epilepsy. I have seen
several cases of internal exostosis development, but in all cases their
discovery was accidental.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Clinical characteristics.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Exostoses vary greatly both in size
and consistency. Some are densely hard&mdash;ivory exostoses&mdash;others
possess a covering of compact bone, whilst their interior is made up
of cancellous tissue continuous with that of the bone from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
they arise. The denser variety seldom attain any considerable size,
but the less compact, growing in the direction of least resistance,
often attain such dimensions as to be both unsightly and dangerous.
Thus, a frontal exostosis may invade the frontal air sinus and grow
into the orbital cavity, obliterating the sinus, interfering greatly
with ocular movements, causing protrusion of the globe and even
destruction of the eye.</p>

<p>An aural exostosis may block up the external auditory meatus,
compress the facial nerve, and lead to the development of a mastoid
empyema.</p>

<p>It might also be added that there are a few cases on record in
which a frontal exostosis, by reason of extensive inward growth, has
produced cerebral symptoms&mdash;general compression and intellectual
deterioration.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">In considering the question of treatment, it must
be accepted that, although of slow growth, some of these exostoses
are definitely progressive, tending to interfere with the character and
functions of the region with which they are anatomically situated.
There is also reason to believe that those secondary changes&mdash;sarcomatous,
myxomatous, &amp;c.&mdash;which are occasionally observed in
the exostoses of long bones are also liable to develop in those cranially
situated. The question of treatment hinges, therefore, to a large
extent on the nature and position of the tumour.</p>

<p>When of the ivory type and growing from the flat bones of the
skull, but so situated that no marked deformity or pressure symptoms
are likely to ensue, they may be left alone, but when definitely
progressive and situated in accessible regions, they should be removed.
Their exposure is carried out by the formation of a suitable scalp-flap&mdash;designed
as far as possible so as to be subsequently hidden
by the hairy scalp&mdash;and the exostosis removed by the application
to its base of a Gigli saw. This method is greatly superior to the
older procedures whereby the tumour was chiselled away with hammer
and gouge.</p>

<p>Occasionally the tumour is so dense and presents so wide a basal
attachment that it becomes necessary to attack from a more distant
line, cutting out a trench, deepened to the diploic tissue, circumferentially
around the tumour and levering away the central mass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
When the tumour extends more deeply, involving nearly the whole
thickness of the skull, it may be removed by the application of a small
trephine immediately to one side of the tumour, followed by the use
of de Vilbiss forceps circumferentially around the main mass, thus
freeing it from its surroundings. The resultant gap in the skull
may be protected by one or other of those measures enumerated in
<a href="#Page182">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p><b>Frontal and mastoid</b> exostoses often necessitate formidable
operations insomuch as their size and anatomical relations present
considerable difficulties (see <a href="#Fig94">Fig. 94</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>indications for operation in the case of aural exostoses</b>
are as <span class="nowrap">follows<a id="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. If there is middle-ear suppuration and signs of retention
of pus.</p>

<p>2. When the pressure of the exostosis produces pain which
cannot otherwise be relieved.</p>

<p>3. If the exostosis nearly blocks up the meatus of both ears,
and there is prospect of each side becoming completely blocked in the
near future. Here operation is carried out on the worst side.</p>

<p>4. If the meatus is nearly blocked by the exostosis and the
patient going to a country where he cannot be within easy reach of
a competent medical man.</p>

<p>The <b>indications for operation in the case of a frontal
exostosis</b> are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. When the exostosis interferes with the actions of the ocular
muscles, causes proptosis and threatens the integrity of the globe.</p>

<p>2. When associated with pain which cannot otherwise be
relieved.</p>

<p>3. When the exostosis leads to blockage of the accessory sinuses
of the nose, more especially when such blockage is associated with
pus pent up within.</p>

<p>4. When very unsightly.</p>

<p>The accompanying <a href="#Fig94">figure</a> illustrates the deformity and dangers
associated with large frontal exostoses. The tumour developed from
the inner angle of the orbital cavity, pushing the globe forwards and
outwards, with diplopia and severe neuralgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span></p>

<p>It is barely possible to enter into the <b>operative details</b> suited to
frontal and aural exostoses&mdash;the operations are so atypical. It is
sufficient to say that the operation may be a very formidable one,
that the details must be carefully thought out, and that every precaution
must be adopted to avoid injuring neighbouring structures.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94. An Exostosis of the Orbit.</span></p>
</div>

<h4 class="centersmall">SARCOMATA, PRIMARY AND TRAUMATIC</h4>

<p>Primary sarcomata of the skull, when compared to sarcomata
developing in other situations, is undoubtedly a rare disease. Still,
many cases have been recorded, and four have come under my own
personal care, one of which is depicted in the <a href="#Fig95">figure</a>.</p>

<p>The disease is equally prevalent in the two sexes, and, excluding
chloromata (see <a href="#Page334">p. 334</a>), usually develops at or after middle life.
The growth may originate in the diploic tissue (as a myelogenous
tumour), or may spring from the pericranium. The cellular structure
varies accordingly. More commonly the cells are of the large round
or spindle type, and are proportionately malignant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span></p>

<p>As regards site of development, the temporal bone (squamous
portion) is most commonly involved, next to which comes the frontal
bone.</p>

<p>In considering the &aelig;tiology of sarcoma in general, <i>trauma</i> must
always be taken into account, for it is an undoubted fact that it
plays an important part in the development of this dire disease.
With respect to the skull similar factors come into play. For instance,
Fr&ouml;hlking,<a id="FNanchor79"></a><a href="#Footnote79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
after collecting 48 cases of sarcoma of the skull, found
a definite history of trauma in 9-21 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig95">
<img src="images/illo331.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="458" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95. An Extrinsic Sarcoma of the Skull.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Ziegler<a id="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> lays down the following essentials in establishing the
traumatic origin of the tumour: It must develop directly after the
trauma on the basis of the swelling or directly in the scar of the wound.</p>

<p>The tumour must be palpable immediately after the acute
swelling has diminished.</p>

<p>At the site of the trauma constant or intermittent pain must
be present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span></p>

<p>A considerable number of cases of sarcoma of the skull will
fulfil even these arbitrary conditions. Such sarcomata may definitely
be labelled &#8216;traumatic&#8217; sarcomata.</p>

<p>Whether dependent on injury or not, the <i>symptoms</i> associated
with sarcoma of the skull vary according to whether the tumour is
extrinsic or intrinsic&mdash;whether, for instance, the growth develops
in the inward direction and presses on the brain, or grows from the
pericranium and is directed externally. <i>Intrinsic</i> tumours, with the
exception of some local pain, &#339;dema of tissues, and dilatation of
superficial veins, give rise to symptoms closely resembling those
observed in intracranial tumour formation. When <i>extrinsic</i>, the
tumour varies in size, but is necessarily attached to the bone, the
base being the widest part of the tumour. In the earlier stages
the overlying skin, with the exception of a few dilated vessels, is
more or less normal. Later on, the integument becomes adherent to
the tumour, then red and inflamed, and finally ulcerated, the growth
now fungating to the surface. The tumour itself is of variable
consistency, first hard, then softer, and lastly semi-fluctuating.</p>

<p>Pain, though not very severe, is more or less constant&mdash;of a dull,
aching character. The extrinsic tumours may, however, give rise to
acute neuralgic pain in the event of implication of cutaneous nerves;
whilst the intrinsic, in the later stages of the disease, lead to the more
severe types of headache observed in intracranial tumour formation.</p>

<p>Secondary nodules appear in other parts of the scalp&mdash;all appertaining,
in their clinical characteristics, to the primary growth; the
cervical glands become infected, and death results from repeated
h&aelig;morrhages, pulmonary complications, &amp;c., usually within one to
two years from the date of primary development.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Treatment.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">The removal of an extrinsic tumour should only
be carried out when the tumour is small and non-adherent to the
tissues of the scalp. With respect to the intrinsic variety greater
circumspection is required. The presence of cerebral symptoms and
the inward extension of the growth&mdash;verified by symptoms and by
X-ray investigation&mdash;may be regarded as implying that the conditions
are beyond the reach of surgery. In both varieties of
tumour, extensive glandular implication acts as a contra-indication
to operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span></p>

<p>Under the more favourable conditions an attempt may be made
at the extirpation of the growth. The operation should be rendered as
bloodless as possible, for which purpose it is essential that the scalp-tourniquet
should be applied as a preliminary measure. A scalp-flap
is then framed, suited to requirements, and allowing of free exposure
of the tumour and surrounding healthy tissues. The skull is then
trephined to one side of the growth, and the disk removed. The dura
is separated from the overlying bone, and by the circumferential
application of de Vilbiss or other craniectomy forceps the central
mass is isolated and removed. During these manipulations free
h&aelig;morrhage may be experienced from the numerous dilated diploic
veins. For the arrest of this the surgeon should have ready to hand,
ivory pegs, bone-wax, and other aids for the control of h&aelig;morrhage
(see <a href="#Page10">Chapter II</a>). The scalp-flap is then replaced.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig96">
<img src="images/illo333.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96. An Intrinsic Sarcoma of the Skull.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The gap in the bone may be covered in, at a later date, if the
patient&#8217;s condition is favourable.</p>

<p>The operation may be a formidable one, but records are to hand
of 35 cases in which radical measures were adopted. Ten cases died
from the operation, 13 were well for periods varying from six months
to six years; and recurrence took place soon after the operation in
21 cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span></p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Chloromata.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">Chloroma, a peculiar type of sarcoma characterized
by the pale green hue of the tissues, usually develops in the
young. The cells are small and round, the pigment distributed in
and around the cell elements. The colour, said to be dependent on
the presence of a pigmented fat, is most intense immediately after the
removal of the tumour, fading rapidly on exposure to light.</p>

<p>The tumour develops from the periosteum of bones, more
especially from those which enter into the formation of the orbit
and base of skull. In fact, nearly all the cases reported have originated
from the temporal and orbital regions. Great rapidity of growth
and early dissemination throughout the viscera are conspicuous
features&mdash;no organ of the body can be said to be exempt from
metastatic deposits. The meninges and brain are early involved by
direct extension.</p>

<p>Proptosis, as the result of cavernous sinus thrombosis and orbital
invasion, is a prominent and early symptom. Death results within
six months. No treatment, surgical or otherwise, is of any avail.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Carcinoma</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">can only involve the skull-bones as a metastatic
deposit&mdash;more commonly in association with mammary cancer&mdash;or
by direct invasion from an overlying epitheliomatous scalp ulcer.
In the former instance, any radical treatment would be contrary to
all surgical principles. In the latter case, presuming that the cervical
glandular region is unaffected or capable of removal, the scalp ulcer
should be freely excised together with the whole thickness of underlying
bone. The resultant osseous gap may be covered in by means
of a plastic flap derived from neighbouring healthy tissue.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
